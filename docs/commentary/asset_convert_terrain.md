## Grass (GRAS) conversion — record invariants + shader profile (2026-07-09)
<a id="grass-conversion-record-invariants-shader"></a>
- Skyrim grass spawns purely from LAND texture layers whose LTEX has GNAM — no REFR/region records involved. Chain verified in output ESM: GRAS DATA layout byte-matches the xEdit TES5 def; LTEX GNAM links and subrecord order (EDID/TNAM/MNAM/HNAM/SNAM/GNAM) match vanilla; all 419,902 LAND BTXT/ATXT layers resolve to real LTEX (~120k grass-linked); WRLD DATA bit 0x80 = "No Grass" must stay clear.
- **GRAS record invariants (the working-example pattern)**: every working GRAS record — vanilla Skyrim.esm, USSEP, Beyond Skyrim's BSHeartland.esm, Skyrim Extended Cut, Legacy Orsinium (all dumpable from the install with tools/esm/tes5_esm_reader.py) — has (1) **OBND all ZEROS**, never computed mesh bounds, (2) **MODT present** (BSHeartland proves a 12-byte version-2 stub `02000000 00000000 00000000` suffices), and (3) **the model under `meshes\landscape\grass\`** — 45/45 surveyed MODL paths contain `landscape\grass\`; nothing outside it is known to work (same kind of hardcoded naming contract as the `NPC Root [Root]` bone). convert_GRAS builds the record manually to honor all three (MODL via `grass_profile.grass_model_dest()` → `landscape\grass\tes4_<basename>.nif`, flattened — TES4 grass basenames are collision-free), and `grass_profile.run()` copies each converted grass NIF there (sources under tes4\ stay for FLOR/STAT sharing). BSHeartland also shows GRAS DATA density up to 80 and TES4-style values are fine; LTEX INAM (SSE "Is Snow" flag) is optional.
- **Grass NIFs with Vertex_Alpha + low VC alpha look invisible/ghosted in NifSkope — that is normal and matches vanilla** (vanilla grass VC alpha avg ~0.15; NifSkope multiplies it into the alpha test, the in-game grass shader uses it as wind weight instead). Don't diagnose grass visibility in NifSkope. Alpha-test thresholds are clamped to the vanilla grass envelope (≤100; Oblivion used up to 128).
- **GRAS DATA Density/PositionRange must be clamped to the working envelope** (Density ≤80, PositionRange ≤32 — vanilla uses Density 3-6/PosRange ≤32, BSHeartland up to Density 80). TES4 values (Density up to 100, PosRange up to 90) were tuned for Oblivion's 4x-coarser placement grid (iMinGrassSize 80 vs Skyrim 20); passed through raw they over-instance the grass planter and CTD **with no crash log** on cells where dense grass textures cover whole quadrants (found via `python tools/esm/cell_grass.py export/Oblivion.esm --wrld Tamriel --cell X,Y` — lists the grass types each cell can spawn; the two density-100 types were the outliers shared by the crashing cells).
- **Grass CTD root cause #2 — Oblivion meshes with NO triangle data (SOLVED 2026-07-10)**: several vanilla Oblivion grass meshes (GroundCoverMediumGrass01/LongGrass01, GroundCoverPineappleWeed*, GroundCoverWildPlant*, ms14longgrass01) ship NiTriShapeData with `has_triangles=False` — Num Triangles is set but the index array is ABSENT (only `Oblivion - Meshes.bsa` has them; no intact alternates exist). Oblivion's grass renderer tolerated it; Skyrim's planter dereferences the missing data → **region-specific CTD with no log** (Heartland/Cheydinhal cells). Several others (JMMediumGrass*, brmediumgrassyellow01, groundcoverfern01, oblivionmoldroots01) carry legacy vertex **match groups** (no vanilla Skyrim mesh has any) → same crash in Bruma cells. Fix: `asset_convert/nif/tri_reconstruct.py` — blade triangles are reconstructed from the 3-UV-role pattern (base-left/base-right/tip; tip role = highest avg z; each blade pairs a tip with the base pair whose midpoint it tops; winding from stored normals), and match groups are cleared on every converted shape. Both run inside `_convert_strips_or_shape`, so FLOR/STAT meshes sharing these sources heal on full re-runs. Diagnosis method: `tools/esm/cell_grass.py` per-cell grass lists × working-vs-crashing region diff → the defective meshes were exactly the types unique to crashing regions. A mesh with `has_triangles=False` also renders as NOTHING in NifSkope (that was the real cause of the "invisible in NifSkope" report, not vertex alpha).
- **Grass CTD root cause #3 — intermediate NiNode wrapper on rotated sources (SOLVED 2026-07-10)**: Skyrim's grass instancer (`AddCellGrassTask` → `BSMultiStreamInstanceTriShape`) requires grass geometry as a **direct child of the BSFadeNode root** — every working grass NIF (vanilla + converted `gcgorsegrass`/`gclonggrass`) is flat `BSFadeNode → NiTriShape`. But the generic converter's Pass-6c wraps geometry in an inner NiNode whenever the **source root carries a non-identity rotation** (it bakes the rotation into a child NiNode because Skyrim honors child-NiNode rotation but ignores BSFadeNode root rotation for statics). The grass path never traverses that inner node → dereferences garbage (`rdi=0x0001000100010001`, `movzx ecx,[rdi+0x32]`) → **CTD** on any cell spawning the type. Hit TES4 **BWCattail01/02/03** (their source roots are rotated; the crash object was `BWCattail02` with a nested `NiNode "BWCattail02"`). Fix: `grass_profile._flatten_grass_root()` (runs inside `apply_grass_profile`) bakes each plain NiNode wrapper's transform into its geometry's verts+normals and re-parents the geometry onto the root, dropping the empty NiNode — world-space geometry preserved (verified: Z height extent unchanged). Only collapses bare NiNode wrappers holding pure geometry (no collision/controller/extra-data). Diagnosis: crash log named `tes4_bwcattail02.nif` + `BSFadeNode`/`NiNode` both named "BWCattail02"; block dump vs a working converted grass NIF showed the extra nesting; source root rotation identity=False (vs gcgorsegrass identity=True, which stayed flat).
- Known remaining grass-NIF oddities (not crash-related, grass renders): most grass tex[1] `_n.dds` normal maps don't exist (vanilla grass points tex[1] at `textures\effects\HighFrequencyNormals.dds` or the literal string `NOR`); bwcattail03 references BWCatTail02.dds which is absent from the extracted BSAs.
- **BSHeartland.esm is the best reference for "custom worldspace + custom grass records that provably work"** — compare against it before vanilla when a worldspace-scoped feature is dead.
- Grass NIFs additionally get the vanilla grass shader profile (`asset_convert/lod/grass_profile.py`, run by `asset_pipeline.convert_meshes`; models identified from the export's `GRAS.txt`): NiAlphaProperty alpha-test only (blend bit clear), SLSF1 OwnEmit+VertexAlpha set / Specular clear (Specular + glossiness 0 = pow(NdotH,0)=1 white-out), emissive ×1.0, gloss 80, spec white/1.0, lighting effects 0.3/2.0, clamp 0 — matching every vanilla LE grass mesh in `references/Skyrim Meshes/meshes/landscape/grass/`. Geometry/UVs/vertex-color alpha (wind weight) preserved.
- 8 Shivering Isles grass models (Plants\Dementia\*, Plants\Mania\*) are absent from the extracted BSAs — their GRAS records exist but have no mesh until SI assets are extracted.

## Terrain/LOD/LAND-adjacent asset notes
<a id="terrainlodland-adjacent-asset-notes"></a>

### WRLD World Bounds (NAM0/NAM9)
- NAM0 (bounds min) and NAM9 (bounds max) store X, Y as raw float world-unit values (same scale as TES4)
- xEdit **displays** them scaled by `1/4096` (cell units) but the raw file value is NOT divided
- TES4 exports `NAM0.MinX=-262144.0` → write exactly -262144.0 to TES5 file (do NOT divide by 4096)
- If divided: NAM0=-64.0 looks like valid cell coords but is actually 64 times smaller than needed → SSELodGen won't generate world map correctly

### 🔴 MTTC targets and sequence blocks must be dropped TOGETHER (2026-08-10)

Crashes `crash-2026-08-10-00-42-35` / `-00-51-26` / `-00-53-49`:
`EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` at `VCRUNTIME140.dll+0019BCF`,
`movdqu xmm2, [rax]` with `rax=0`. This one names its own cause in the object
list: `NiControllerSequence`, `BGSGamebryoSequenceGenerator`, behavior graph
`spiddalcloudplant`, `BSFadeNode "spiddalplant"
("tes4\Oblivion\Plants\SpiddalCloudPlant.NIF")`. It fires **when the plant
animates** (walking up to a Spiddal Stick as it spews its cloud), not on cell
load.

`NiMultiTargetTransformController.extra_targets` is a **POSITIONAL** list: the
engine pairs slot N with the `NiControllerSequence` controlled-block that
drives it. Break the pairing either way and the slot resolves to a null
interpolator, which the sequence generator dereferences.

**Both directions were shipped and both crashed identically** — worth
recording, because each looked correct in isolation:

1. The original code dropped any controlled block whose node name equalled the
   **root node's** name, leaving `num_extra_targets` unchanged. Oblivion
   routinely names the root and its animated node the same thing
   (`spiddalcloudplant.nif`'s root IS `spiddalplant`, also extra-target #1),
   so the target lost its driver. Source 10 blocks / 3 targets → ours 9 / 3.
2. "Keep the root-named block so the target matches" — this restored 10/3 and
   **still crashed**, because a root-targeting entry is itself illegal.

Census of 141 sequences across 43 animated vanilla meshes, and **both numbers
are zero**:

| invariant | vanilla |
|---|---|
| controlled blocks targeting their own root | **0** |
| MTTC extra targets with no controlled block | **0** |

Vanilla satisfies both by never listing the root as a target at all. So the
correct fix is to drop the block **and** remove that node from every MTTC
target list, decrementing `num_extra_targets` with it (`_drop_mttc_target`).
Result on the crashing mesh: 9 blocks / **2** targets, root absent, every
target driven.

Blast radius: **413 meshes**, including `obcloud01.nif` and
`oblivionsmokeemitter01.nif` — the two REFRs that appeared in the earlier
`SkyrimSE+050E6AD` logs, where a separate LOD fault happened to crash first.
Audit with `tools/validate/mttc_target_check.py`; guarded by
`tests/test_asset_convert.py::TestMTTCTargetsStayInSyncWithControlledBlocks`,
which drives the REAL converter (a hand-built MTTC tests pyffi's reference
arrays, not the converter).

### 🔴 A graph-bound mesh must ship NO empty text keys (2026-08-10)

Crashes `crash-2026-08-10-01-08-13` / `-01-39-02` / `-01-41-07` — the Spiddal
Stick and Harrada Root CTDs that survived both the MTTC fix (above) and every
Rest-state theory.  Same signature as the MTTC family (`movdqu xmm2,[rax]`,
rax=0, VCRUNTIME140, under `BGSGamebryoSequenceGenerator`) but a different
null.

**Mechanism, from disassembly** (`tools/disasm/address_lib.py --log` → GOG RVA
`0x505130`, Address Library ID 32774; crash site is the call returning to
`+0x1B0`): on state activation the generator walks the activated
`NiControllerSequence`'s `NiTextKeyExtraData` translating keys into behavior
events.  Each value is first matched WHOLE against the project's registered
event table (hash map on `BShkbHkxDB::ProjectDBData+0xC8`); on a miss the
engine calls `strchr(value, '.')` to split an `Event.Payload` key
(`mov edx, 0x2e` right before the crashing call — and the crash log's
`R9=0x2E2E` is strchr's broadcast needle).  The strchr runs on the RAW string
pointer: an **empty NiString loads as a NULL BSFixedString**, and the read of
address 0 is the CTD.  So the crash fires the moment the object first
animates — the Spiddal Stick spewing its cloud as the player walks up.

The sources really do ship empty keys — Oblivion authored them freely and its
engine ignored them: `spiddalcloudplant.nif`'s Forward has `t=0.1 ''`,
`harradauprightattack.nif` has SEVEN of them.

**Vanilla census draws the exact legality line:**

| where | empty text keys |
|---|---|
| graph-carrying meshes (animobjects, traps, furniture) | **0** |
| graph-less meshes | 2 (`impjaildoor01`, `ruinscanopicjar02` — plain Open/Close) |
| keys with trailing whitespace (`'Sound: X\r\n'`) | 107 in dungeons alone — **legal, do not trim** |

Empty keys are tolerated on the graph-less path (vanilla ships them and those
doors work), and lethal on the graph path (vanilla ships none).  So the fix
(`_strip_empty_text_keys`) drops whitespace-only keys **only for meshes that
get an animobject graph** — converted graph-less doors stay byte-identical to
what already works.  Verified: `idsecretwall01` and `doceilingcollapse01`
(the ImperialDungeon01 hidden door and falling rubble) re-convert
byte-identical; the plants lose exactly their empty keys and keep
`start`/`end`/`sound:` verbatim, including the vanilla-legal trailing `\r\n`.

Audit: `tools/validate/gamebryo_seq_check.py` (check 3).  Guarded by
`tests/test_asset_convert.py::TestGraphMeshesShipNoEmptyTextKeys`, driven
through the real converter on both crashing meshes.

### 🔴 LODSettings must COVER the terrain, or the worldspace CTDs on entry (2026-08-10)

Crashes `crash-2026-08-09-23-15-19` through `crash-2026-08-10-00-16-34`, all
byte-identical: `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` at `SkyrimSE.exe+050E6AD`,
`mov rbx, [rax+rcx*8]` with `rax=0`, on a `BSJobs::JobThread`, in
`Plane of Oblivion`. **Reproducible with `coc OblivionMQKvatchEntrance`** —
which is what proved it is the worldspace's own load path, not the Oblivion
gate, the transition, or any script.

The engine builds its terrain-LOD quadtree from `LODSettings/<WRLD>.lod`: root
at SW, `size` cells across, recursively subdivided into 4 children
(`0x4d1020` recurses over `[node+0x30]` with exactly 4 children, stride 0x50).
A `.btr` tile outside that square has **no node**, and the per-frame walk
indexes the node array with **no bounds check**.

Cause: `write_lod_settings` took its extents from `WRLD.MNAM` alone, and **57
of 84 TES4 worldspaces author no usable MNAM** — so `sw == ne == 0` arrived,
and the old `size = 1 << ceil(log2(ne - sw))` plus `eff_sw = -(size // 2)`
produced a **1×1 grid** (`SWx=0 SWy=1`) for every converted worldspace, while
LODGen still emitted tiles out to (-32,-32).

Fix, in two parts:
- Extents are measured from the **CELLS** (always carry XCLC), unioned with
  MNAM only when MNAM is populated.
- `size` grows from 4 until the square covers `[sw, ne)`; **SW is the literal
  terrain corner, NOT snapped or centred**, and `maxLOD` tracks `size`
  (capped at 32) rather than being hardcoded to 32.

Ground truth — vanilla `.lod` files extracted from `Skyrim - Meshes0.bsa`
(layout `<hhIII` = SWx i16, SWy i16, size u32, minLOD u32, maxLOD u32):

| worldspace | SW | size | minLOD | maxLOD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| japhetsfollyworld | (-9, -6) | 16 | 4 | **16** |
| dlc01falmervalley | (-16, -13) | 32 | 4 | 32 |
| skuldafnworld | (0, -21) | 64 | 4 | 32 |

The new formula reproduces the first two **exactly** from their cell extents,
which is what confirms it rather than merely being self-consistent. Note SW is
unaligned in all three — an earlier attempt that snapped SW down to a multiple
of `size` never converges for a span crossing the origin (the gap grows as
fast as the size). Guarded by
`tests/test_asset_convert.py::TestLODSettingsCoversTheTerrain`.

### Terrain LOD (SSELodGen) — data chain
- LAND BTXT/ATXT subrecords contain direct LTEX FormIDs (NOT indices into VTEX array)
- SSELodGen uses: BTXT.Texture(LTEX) → LTEX.TNAM(TXST) → TXST.TX00(path) → Data\Textures\{path}
- VTEX subrecord is a supplementary lookup array; most Oblivion LAND records don't have it (29/31823)
  - TES5 LAND VTEX format: packed array of uint32 LTEX FormIDs, one subrecord total (not per-quadrant)
  - Null slots (zero FormID) are valid and common — NOT a bug
- Landscape textures extracted from BSA are DXT1 BC1 512x512 — fully supported by SSELodGen
- If terrain LOD appears purple after correct data install: ensure OLD LOD tiles are deleted before regenerating

### Distant LOD generation (one-click, rebuilt 2026-07-06) — `convert.py` Phase 8 `phase_lod`
Two pieces, both native, both re-enabled in the pipeline (`generate_lod` + `generate_terrain_lod`).

**Terrain LOD** (`asset_convert/lod/terrain_lod.py` + `terrain_lod_textures.py`): per-tile `.btr` heightmap NIF + composited diffuse `.dds` + heightmap-derived BC5 normal `.dds`, LOD levels 4/8/16/32. TES4Tamriel = 1301 tiles.
- **The old diffuse was the bug**: it upscaled raw LAND VCLR vertex colors → a blurry color grid (why distant terrain looked wrong). FIX: `terrain_lod_textures.composite_cell()` composites the REAL landscape textures — resolve LTEX FormID→diffuse via `build_ltex_texture_map` (LAND BTXT/ATXT → LTEX.TNAM → TXST.TX00 = `tes4\landscape\*.dds`), then per quadrant blend base + alpha layers using the ATXT/VTXT opacity grid (17×17, pos=row*17+col, sorted by ATXT layer index), ×VCLR shading at 0.4 strength (full x2 caused hard cell seams). Landscape UV repeats every 2 cells.
- **Compositor orientation contract (fixed 2026-07-09 — the "large single color areas" bug was three separate defects):**
  1. **Quadrants with no BTXT base layer** (22.6% of Tamriel quadrants, whole sea floor) rendered flat grey-128. The engine's default for unpainted land is `Landscape\Default.dds` → `DEFAULT_LAND_TEXTURE = tes4\landscape\default.dds`. Cells with NO LAND record now also composite (default texture) instead of a flat fill.
  2. **V ran the wrong way**: the diffuse tile is written image-row-0 = NORTH, so world V must DECREASE as the image row grows. Sampling with ascending V mirrored every quadrant and broke ground-texture continuity at every quadrant boundary (horizontal banding every half cell). Same flip applies to VTXT opacity grids and VCLR (LAND row 0 = SOUTH → `np.flipud` to image space), and to the heightmap-derived normal map (`_heightmap_normal_rgb` flips + negates the row gradient so the `_n.dds` matches the diffuse orientation — it was N/S-mirrored vs the diffuse before).
  3. **No underwater murk**: vanilla/xLODGen LOD diffuse bakes submerged terrain toward a flat murky colour; without it the sea floor reads as bright land. `composite_cell(heights=, water_height=)` blends toward `MURK_COLOR` by depth (`MURK_FULL_DEPTH=512`, cap `MURK_MAX=0.9`).
  - Ground truth for row-0=north: xLODGen's own `tamriel.32.0.32.dds` (northern Sea of Ghosts at the TOP).
- `.btr` structure = `BSMultiBoundNode` "chunk" → child[0] `NiTriShape` "land" (scale=level, local 0..4096 verts, shader type 18 LODLandscapeNoise, no normals/vcol), child[1] optional WATER node → `BSMultiBound`/`BSMultiBoundAABB`. Loads in-game; AABB magnitude matches vanilla LOD4. (xLODGen source only READS .btr for object-face culling — terrain .btr generation is entirely ours.)
- **Land UVs are REQUIRED and meaningful** (fixed 2026-07-09): vanilla maps the tile texture across the tile with `u = x/4096`, `v = 1 − y/4096` (v=0 = NORTH edge = DDS row 0). "UVs are irrelevant for terrain .btr" was only true of how xLODGen *reads* them — the ENGINE samples them. All-zero UVs make every triangle sample one texel → each tile renders as a single flat colour → the in-game/world-map "hard-edged checkerboard, one colour per tile" symptom. Water shape has NO UVs (num_uv_sets=0), matching vanilla.
- **LOD water (added 2026-07-09, vanilla-exact)**: child[1] = `BSMultiBoundNode` named `WATER` (scale 1) → one shape with an independent flat quad per water cell (4 verts/2 tris each, cell-local size 4096/level, Z = water height / level, NO shader/UV/normals — the engine textures it from WRLD NAM3). LOD4 uses `BSSegmentedTriShape` with EXACTLY 16 segments (fixed 4×4 grid, column-major sx*4+sy, so the engine can hide quads over loaded cells); LOD8/16/32 use plain `NiTriShape`. Segment binary layout (nif.xml `BSGeometrySegmentData`): `flags:byte=0, start_index:uint (tri-POINTS, 0 when segment empty), num_primitives:uint`; PyFFI's `BSSegment` fields are misaligned over the same 9 bytes — write `internal_index = start<<8` and `flags.bsseg_water = 1` (== num_prims 2 << 8). WATER AABB: XY = quad bbox in world units rel. tile origin; Z spans [min water height, max(max height, 0)]. Water cells = CELL HasWater (DATA bit 0x02) AND terrain dips below the cell water height (XCLW override valid only in ±1e9, else WRLD DNAM default).
  - **The old CTD** (BSMultiBoundNode "Water" → null deref): the engine's LOD-water path derefs the worldspace's WATR via **WRLD NAM3** — the fix is NOT to avoid the node, it's to write NAM2/NAM3 = Skyrim.esm DefaultWater (0x18) + NAM4 (LOD water height, 0 for Oblivion) in `convert_WRLD`. Also: TES4 CELL XCLW `-2147483648.0` = "use default" sentinel — must be OMITTED on conversion, not written as a literal height.
- Normal map derived from the heightmap gradient (`_heightmap_normal_rgb` + real BC5 via `_encode_bc4_block`), replacing the old flat normal so distant terrain is lit.
- Debug single tiles without a full run: `python tools/lod/terrain_lod_render.py` (rebuilds specific tiles in-process, reports water quads, dumps diffuse PNG). `python -m tools.lod.terrain_lod_tex_probe [--cell X Y]` audits LTEX→TXST→dds resolution and per-cell layers.
- Validate with `python tools/lod/terrain_lod_render.py --esm output/oblivion.esm/oblivion.esm --worldspace TES4Tamriel --cell X Y --radius R` → side-by-side hillshade + composited diffuse (the primary iteration tool; do NOT byte-match vanilla .btr). `tools/lod/lod_nif_inspect.py` dumps .btr/.bto geometry+shader.
- **🔴 A worldspace a MASTER defines is ALWAYS sourced from that master, with the plugin as an OVERLAY — never from the plugin alone, however much terrain it adds** (2026-08-11, Tamriel.esp). `convert.py::_records_esm` used to hand record ownership to whichever file held the *bulk* of the LAND records. That silently inverts for a plugin which **extends** a master's worldspace rather than patching it: Tamriel.esp adds a landmass around Cyrodiil (99,910 LAND vs Oblivion.esm's 31,823), won ownership, and every tile was then built from the plugin ALONE — all of the master's own terrain was missing from the heightmap and `fill_missing` edge-extended it into flat plateaus. Symptom: tile-sized discontinuities along the vanilla border, **worst at level 32** where one tile spans 32×32 cells (tile `32.0.-32` had 86 of 1024 cells and encoded world Z `4096..16416` instead of `-4576..20152`; tile `32.0.0` had ZERO cells and rendered dead flat). The tell is that the only level-32 tiles that looked *correct* were the two the plugin never regenerated, so the master's copy survived. Record COUNT never distinguished "patches a worldspace" from "extends a worldspace" and must not decide ownership — the overlay path already expresses "master's terrain + this plugin's edits" correctly and is what the DLC/override case always used. Verify with `Parsing LAND records from <master>, <plugin>` in the run log and a LAND count ABOVE the plugin's own (110,095 vs 99,910 here); a single-file parse line means the bug is back.

**Object LOD + tree billboards** (`asset_convert/lod/lod_gen.py` via `external/lodgen/LODGenx64.exe`): STAT/etc. flagged `0x8000` (Distant LOD)/`0x10000000` (World Map) by size in the importer get baked into `.bto`. TREE refs render as **crossed-quad billboard cards** via LODGen's FlatTextures mechanism (`_tree_billboard` points the LOD "model" at `tes4\trees\billboards\<sptstem>.dds` — Oblivion ships 118 billboard renders; `_write_flat_textures` emits the descriptor + a normals file so cards are lit + `_ensure_white_dds`). 91 flat textures, 716/734 LOD4 .bto contain tree billboards. `.btt`/`.lst` vanilla tree-LOD format was deliberately NOT reverse-engineered (risky, unvalidatable) — flat cards in .bto is the reliable Skyblivion path.
- **GOTCHA**: `LODGenx64.exe` runs with cwd=external/lodgen/ → `PathData=` MUST be absolute (`Path(output_dir).resolve()`) or it fails its Data-dir check (exit -1, log "No Data directory"). LODGen's "Oh crap N = N = ..." stderr spam is a harmless degenerate-triangle notice, not an error.
- **GOTCHA — a geometry-rooted NIF kills the ENTIRE worldspace's object LOD** (found 2026-07-27, Morrowind_ob.esm): `LODGenx64` casts every LOD mesh's root block to `NiNode` unchecked, so a root that is a bare `NiTriShape`/`NiTriStrips` throws `System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast … NiTriShape to … NiNode` **on a worker thread, unhandled** → the process dies, writes NO log (the stale log is the previous worldspace's, so it looks like LOD "just didn't run"), and the worldspace ends up with a single junk `.bto`. Two 4-triangle `bcscum02/03.nif` scum patches cost Morrowind_ob all 75,316 of its LOD references. Two independent guards now exist:
  1. `nif_converter` wraps a geometry root in a `NiNode` before the usual `NiNode→BSFadeNode` step (vanilla census: 400/400 sampled Skyrim meshes have a NiNode-derived root — `BSFadeNode` 340, `NiNode` 55, `BSMasterParticleSystem` 2, `BSLeafAnimNode` 3; **zero** geometry roots, so this is invalid for Skyrim regardless of LODGen).
  2. `lod_gen._lod_mesh_is_safe()` screens every listed mesh's root block and drops (with a warning) anything unreadable or non-NiNode, so one bad mesh can never again cost a whole worldspace.
  Note `lod_far_gen` legitimately refuses to build a `_far.nif` for shapes under `_MIN_SRC_TRIS` (20 tris) — such models simply get no LOD entry; a **stale** `_far.nif` left from an older run is what got listed here.
- **`external/lodgen/LODGenx64.exe` is 3.0.36.0 — it REPLACED the 2.2.0.0 build of the same name** (2026-08-09; the 2.2 exe was deleted, so an old checkout's `LODGenx64.exe` is a different program). The guards above screen the *root block*, but a mesh can still fault LODGen deeper in the walk — and 2.2 handles **no** exceptions anywhere, so any such throw on a ThreadPool worker kills the process and loses every tile not yet written. Nehrim: 28 of 418 tiles, twice in a row, from ONE model (`LeyawiinHouseLower01`, 5 refs game-wide) throwing `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in `LODApp.TransformShape` → `IterateNodes` → `ParseNif`. 3.0.36.0 catches the same fault **per object**, prints `Error processing <EditorID>`, and finishes the worldspace, so one bad model costs only its own distant LOD (it pops in at load distance).
  - Verified equivalent before switching: on identical input both versions emit the same tile set with the same block structure (39 `BSSegmentedTriShape`/`BSMultiBoundNode` per tile, NIF 20.2.0.7); 3.x only reduces slightly tighter (48,993 vs 49,527 tris on the sampled tile).
  - **3.x's exit code is NOT a success signal**: 0 on a clean run, but nonzero when any object failed *even though the bake completed and every tile was written*. `run_lodgen` therefore judges success by `.bto` files present in `PathOutput`, and logs the skipped EditorIDs as a warning.
  - The mesh is not at fault — repairing `LeyawiinHouseLower01`'s tangent flag and recomputing its missing normals each made 2.2 crash *earlier*. Don't chase the mesh; the bug is inside LODGen.
- **A plugin's LOD bakes its MASTERS' models too**, and those textures were only converted into the master's output (Morrowind_ob places Oblivion architecture in its own worldspace → 117 `.bto`-referenced textures missing). `_fill_missing_lod_textures(master_tex_roots=…)` copies them in, and the normal-map synthesis prefers a master's real `_n.dds` over a flat fallback. Note `master_dirs` is set only when a master owns the WORLDSPACE, so the texture fallback uses its own `master_texture_dirs` argument (always this plugin's masters) — do not conflate the two.
- `_promote_lod_textures` copies .bto-referenced textures to the textures root AND synthesizes missing NORMAL maps (`_a_n.dds` atlas normals + any missing `_n.dds`) from the source normal or a flat normal — LODGen writes atlas diffuse but not atlas normals, so object LOD would render unlit without this.

**World map** uses terrain LOD (all levels incl. LOD32) + object LOD. WRLD NAM0/NAM9 bounds are RAW float world units (NOT /4096) and MNAM map dims must be correct — both verified in the output ESM.

## Lava surfaces — Oblivion realm water rendered as actual lava (2026-08-23)
<a id="lava-surfaces-oblivion-realm-water"></a>

**Skyrim's water shader physically cannot render lava.** The complete
`BSWaterShaderPixelConstants` table, read out of SkyrimSE.exe at `0x1455789`,
is: `ShallowColor DeepColor ReflectionColor FresnelRI CameraData ProjData
VarAmounts SunDir SunColor NumLights LightPos LightColor WaterParams
DepthControl SSRParams`. **No diffuse texture slot and no emissive term** — the
three colors only tint a reflection/refraction result. All 93 `NNAM` entries
across vanilla Skyrim's 34 WATR records name the same `DefaultWater.dds`, which
is the normal/noise map, not a color map. Oblivion's lava colors are DARK
(`shallow=(79,12,2)`) precisely because they tinted a bright emissive texture
Skyrim has no way to sample, so a faithful WATR port renders as dark water.
Chasing better WATR values is a dead end.

**Bethesda's own answer is geometry.** Dawnguard's Aetherium Forge
(`DLC1Bthalft01`) layers two things: `LavaSettings` (WATR, reached by the
cell's `XCWT`) for the PHYSICS — swim, damage, fog, plus an `INAM` image space
for being submerged — and `DweSpecialForgeLava01/02/03.nif` for the LOOK, an
ordinary mesh with a `BSEffectShaderProperty`:
`source_texture=WavyTurbulence01.dds`, `greyscale_texture=GradHotCoals.dds`,
`emissive 1,1,1 × 2.0`, and a `BSEffectShaderPropertyFloatController` on
U Offset. `Skyrim.esm`'s own `LavaWater` record is **dead data** — zero cell,
worldspace, or REFR references; the only "lava" strings in Skyrim.esm are
Olava the Feeble.

**Our implementation**: `asset_convert/lava_surface.py` generates the plane,
`tes5_import/lava_placement.py` places it. Oblivion's `oblivionlava06.dds` is
already full colour (DXT1 blocks decode to `(230,97,49)`, `(222,64,32)`; mean
channel spread 151/255), so it goes straight into `source_texture` and the
greyscale-to-palette path is NOT used — setting `slsf_1_greyscale_to_palette_color`
without binding a gradient samples a missing texture.

**Lava is identified from AUTHORED data only**: a WATR is lava when
`MNAM.MaterialID == "lava"` (Oblivion.esm: exactly `OblivionLavaTest01` and
`OblivionCitadelLavaPlane`; Nehrim: `LavaLow`, `LavaDurchsichtig`). A cell gets
a plane when its `XCWT.Water` is such a record, or — failing that — when it
inherits one via its worldspace's `NAM2.Water`, which is how the engine itself
resolves a cell's water. **Never infer from the worldspace being an "Oblivion
realm"**: that flag says nothing about whether the water is lava. Oblivion.esm
yields 7,765 planes (7,719 exterior on the 4096-unit cell grid, 46 interior at
their authored `XCLW` heights).

### Three bugs that each cost an in-game test cycle — check these FIRST

All three produce a mesh that is perfectly valid on disk, loads without crash
or warning, and is silently wrong in game:

1. **No `BSXFlags` on the root → the scroll never runs.** Skyrim only ticks a
   mesh's time controllers when the root sets BSXFlags **bit 0 (Animated)**.
   The controller sits in the file and the texture is frozen. Vanilla lava
   ships `BSX=1` (collisionless + animated). Identical to the fire-invisibility
   root cause above — the same trap, twice.
2. **Reversed winding → invisible from above.** With `a=(x,y)`, `b=(x+1,y)`,
   `c=(x,y+1)`, winding `(a,c,b)` yields a **−Z** normal and the plane
   backface-culls exactly where the player stands. Correct is `(a,b,c)` /
   `(b,d,c)`. Compute the cross product; do not trust the comment.
3. **Controller `target` unset → animation never binds.** Vanilla sets
   `.target` on every shader float controller, as does `nif_converter.py` at
   all six of its own sites.

Also match `texture_clamp_mode = 0xFF03` (both vanilla and our own working
converted meshes; a bare `3` differs) and controller `flags = 0x48`
(Active | Compute Scaled Time — without the scaled-time bit the curve does not
advance). `NiFloatInterpolator.float_value` may be `0.0`: our shipped,
in-game-confirmed scrolling meshes (streetlamps, flame atronach) use `0.0` and
animate fine, so it is **not** the blocker it first appears to be.

Guarded by `tests/test_lava_surface.py` (5 tests, each asserting one of the
silent-failure properties).


## FO3/FNV keys LOD by EditorID

**Code:** `asset_convert/lod/terrain_lod_falloutnv.py`

`shipped_lod_worldspaces` treats the source game's own shipped LOD assets as
the authority on which worldspaces deserve distant LOD. Oblivion and Nehrim key
those tiles by the worldspace's **decimal FormID**, flat in one directory:

    meshes\landscape\lod\113463.-32.-32.32.nif
    textures\landscapelod\generated\<formid>.*.dds

FO3/FNV key the same assets by **EditorID**, one directory per worldspace:

    meshes\landscape\lod\wastelandnv\wastelandnv.level4.x-2.y3.nif
    textures\landscape\lod\freesidefortworld\normals\...

A FormID-only scan therefore finds nothing in a FO3/FNV tree, so
`lod_capable_worldspaces` returns empty and the LOD dialog offers no
worldspaces at all. The reported reason -- "ships no distant LOD of its own" --
is measurably wrong: FalloutNV.esm extracts **4,394** LOD meshes across **18**
worldspace directories, against Oblivion's 104 files, and `wastelandnv` is
one of them.

Both layouts are now scanned. The tile count is only a relative weight used to
rank worldspaces, so every file under a worldspace's directory counts,
`blocks` and `normals` subfolders included.


## Why the WRLD scan includes masters

**Code:** `_worldspace_edids` in `asset_convert/lod/terrain_lod.py`

An OVERRIDE plugin ships LOD assets for a worldspace it does not itself define.
The GOTY `DLCShiveringIsles.esp` is an 85-byte header-only stub -- every
Shivering Isles record was merged into Oblivion.esm -- yet its BSA supplies
every SEWorld LOD tile. Scanning only the plugin's own WRLD.txt leaves the
FormID lookup falling through to a raw hex id that no downstream EditorID match
can resolve, so the worldspace silently drops out of the LOD set.

A master's records are also NOT reliably a sibling directory: an imported mod's
plugins live inside their mod's shared folder, so `.parent` is that folder
rather than `export/`. Masters resolve through the source registry instead.

## QEM decimation: the budget and its tuning constants
<a id="qem-decimation-tuning"></a>

**Code:** `asset_convert/lod/mesh_decimate.py`, called from
`asset_convert/lod/lod_far_gen.py`.

The budget targets roughly vanilla Skyrim object-LOD density +25%. Vanilla
Tamriel spends **~11,000 bytes of object LOD per CELL at level 4** (measured
from `Skyrim - Meshes1.bsa`); before this pass we spent **~410,000, i.e. 37x
vanilla**, because decimation was structurally broken and every constant had
been clamped down to hide the damage:

- Shapes were decimated **independently**, so shared rims drifted apart and
  tore holes. `_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT` froze both rims to limit the drift, and
  `_MIN_SRC_TRIS`/`_MIN_TRIS` deleted small shapes rather than risk them.
- Collapses kept the **original UV**, so charts were squeezed into a third of
  their proper footprint. `MAX_DEV_FRAC` was clamped to 0.03 to limit the
  shearing, which stalled reduction at ~40% of source verts against a nominal
  8% target.

Both defects are fixed — one welded topology per model, UVs interpolated onto
the survivor — so the defensive constants are gone and the real budget stands
on its own.

### Why welding matters

Decimating a model as ONE welded topology is what keeps it watertight. A rim
shared by two shapes is a free boundary to both: each side chooses different
survivors, the rims drift apart, and the gap is the hole. Welding makes the
shared rim one graph node, so a collapse moves both sides at once.

### The constants

| Constant | Value | Role |
|---|---:|---|
| `WELD_EPS` | 1e-3 | position weld tolerance, game units |
| `MAX_DEV_FRAC` | 0.25 | error floor, as a fraction of the model diagonal |
| `TOPO_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT` | 6.0 | budget multiplier per unit of boundary fraction |
| `_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT` | 1.0 | boundary-edge constraint quadric weight (× len²) |
| `_STITCH_FRAC` | 0.008 | proximity-stitch tolerance, fraction of the diagonal |
| `_STITCH_MAX_EDGE_MULT` | 1.0 | stitch radius cap, in median edge lengths |
| `_EDGE_LEN_REG` | 0.5 | edge-length regularization (× mean face area) |

`_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT` used to be 8.0, to stop the two sides of a shared rim
drifting apart — which it could never do, because each side was decimated
separately and nothing made them agree. Now that a model is one welded
topology the seam cannot open, so it only has to hold genuinely open rims
(window frames, wall tops, leaf-card edges) a little longer than interior
geometry.

`MAX_DEV_FRAC` at 0.25 is deliberately loose: at LOD range (2+ km) a quarter
of the model diagonal is well under a pixel of silhouette.

`TOPO_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT` scales the budget by how much of the model is open rim,
since rim vertices are pinned by the open-rim guard — a 30%-rim building gets
2.8x the vertices of a closed rock at the same ratio.

`_STITCH_MAX_EDGE_MULT` caps the stitch radius so a merge never crosses more
than the scale of the authored detail.

### Stitching: why an exact weld is not enough
<a id="qem-stitch-pass"></a>

An exact position weld only joins vertices that **coincide**. Game models are
not built that way: `piratecabin01` is 14 open sheets that overlap and
interpenetrate — visually one solid cabin, topologically **33 separate
components**, with only 20 of 91 shape pairs having any vertex within a unit of
each other. Decimating that divides one budget among 33 pieces, which grinds
each to nothing and takes whole planks with it.

So nodes that are merely CLOSE are merged, not just identical ones. The
tolerance is relative to the model, because "touching" means something
different on a 100-unit crate and an 8,000-unit fort. The stitch runs before
quadrics are built, so the collapse sees one connected surface and simplifies a
plank into its neighbour exactly as it simplifies one rock face into the next.

**The radius is capped by the model's DETAIL scale, not just its overall
size.** A fraction of the diagonal is right for a building, whose planks are
large and genuinely overlap, but on thin repeated geometry it exceeds the size
of the parts themselves and fuses things that merely pass near each other:
`mainmast01` is rigging with a 2,968-unit diagonal and a 9-unit median edge, so
a 24-unit radius welded separate ropes into one and the collapse dragged them
together. Measured across models, radius / median-edge cleanly separates the
two cases:

| model | ratio | wants stitching |
|---|---:|---|
| `piratecabin01` | 0.38 | yes |
| castle | 0.79 | yes |
| IC wall | 1.78 | no |
| `mainmast01` | 2.62 | no |

Hence the cap at the median edge length. When a group is merged the
representative keeps its **original** position — averaging the group would pull
the surface off the silhouette.

### Why welding is what stops seams tearing
<a id="qem-weld-seams"></a>

`tri_mat` tags each input triangle with the material (source shape) it came
from. It is carried through the collapse unchanged and returned alongside the
surviving triangles, which is what lets a whole model be welded into ONE
topology and decimated together: shared rims between shapes become genuinely
shared graph nodes, so a collapse moves both sides at once and the seam cannot
tear. The triangles are split back out per material afterwards.

Decimating each shape separately instead let the two sides of a seam pick
different survivors and drift apart. Measured on `centrancerockmosslg01`, the
shared boundary went from **32% welded to 9%**, and the gap opened from **3.8
to 93.4 units** — 6% of the object diagonal.

### The four collapse guards
<a id="qem-collapse-guards"></a>

Each guard exists because removing it produced a specific measured failure.

**Open-rim guard.** A boundary vertex may only collapse INTO another boundary
vertex, so an open rim simplifies along itself and stays where the author put
it. The constraint quadrics cannot prevent this on their own, because a
half-edge collapse is charged the SURVIVOR's quadric — they only penalise
moving a rim vertex ALONG its edge line, and say nothing about it being
absorbed upward into the body. Measured on `rockgreatforest1125rdm`, whose 106
rim verts all sit at z=-241.2: without the guard only **12 of 178 rim nodes
survived and the rim rose 162 units** — 34% of the model height — leaving the
rock floating above the terrain.

**Per-component floor.** A model is often many DISCONNECTED pieces —
`piratecabin01` is 33 planks, beams and panels — and a global vertex budget
says nothing about how it should be split between them. Asking for 54 vertices
across 33 pieces is ~1.6 each, far below the 4 a closed piece needs, so the
loop ground whole planks out of existence and the "holes" were missing parts,
not torn surface. Every component gets its own floor of `_COMP_MIN = 4`: four
vertices is the minimum for a closed piece (a tetrahedron), and while a flat
open sheet still reads at 3, one wasted vertex on a plank is nothing against
the plank disappearing.

**Isolation guard.** Decimation must never leave a triangle floating on its
own. A collapse removes the faces containing edge (u,v) and rewrites the rest;
if that would strand any surviving neighbour as a triangle sharing no edge with
another live face, the collapse is refused. Without it a low budget shreds a
surface into loose confetti rather than simplifying it, which reads in-game as
holes with stray triangles floating in them.

**Normal-flip guard.** A collapse is rejected if it would flip an adjacent
face's normal.

### Stranded vertices must be counted
<a id="qem-stranded-verts"></a>

A degenerating face can strand a THIRD vertex — not just `u` or `v` — by taking
its last face away. Those have to be counted, or `alive` drifts above the real
vertex count and the loop keeps collapsing long after the budget is met:
`piratecabin01` asked for 54 vertices and was ground down to **14, losing 10 of
its 14 shapes**.

### UV charts: why the corner UV is mutable
<a id="qem-uv-charts"></a>

A collapse u→v moves the corner's POSITION to v while the corner keeps u's
ORIGINAL UV. The triangle then covers the geometry both vertices used to span,
but its UV footprint is unchanged — so the chart is squeezed into less and less
of the texture as collapses accumulate. Measured on
`rockgreatforest1500fgdrlichen`: the far mesh retains **96.3% of the source's
geometric area but only 32.3% of its UV area**, leaving 80% of triangles below
half the source texel density. On `icexteriorwall02` the density spread reached
**53,303x** — a single-texel streak, which reads in-game as a garbled or
invisible texture.

The fix is a MUTABLE UV per corner that moves with the vertex: when u collapses
into v, the corner's UV becomes the point in u's chart corresponding to v's
position. The face still holds its other two corners, whose UVs are known and
whose positions are unchanged, so the face defines a local affine map from
position to UV; solving it for v's position gives exactly where v lands in this
face's chart. UVs are piecewise-linear over the surface, so this is exact and
keeps the chart's area in step with the geometry it covers. A degenerate face
leaves the UV unchanged.

A corner's UV is per-FACE once it starts moving, since two faces sharing a
vertex can sit in different charts, so each corner gets its own slot.

### Deliberately NO component-pruning fallback
<a id="qem-no-component-pruning"></a>

An earlier version dropped whole connected components smallest-area-first when
collapses stalled above target. That was written when each SHAPE was decimated
alone, so a "component" meant a disconnected island within one shape. Now that
a model is decimated as ONE welded soup, every shape is its own component, and
the same code deleted entire shapes to meet the budget: `piratecabin01` went
from **14 shapes / 2,686 verts to 4 shapes / 15 verts**, and
`ruinshallnxdeadenda01` lost most of its geometry the same way.

Overshooting the budget is far better than deleting parts of the model, so a
shape is simply left heavier than target when the error floor genuinely blocks
further collapses.

### Scalar arithmetic in the inner loop
<a id="qem-scalar-inner-loop"></a>

`cost_of`, `flips` and `uv_at` are written out longhand in plain Python
scalars rather than NumPy. They run ~100k times per shape on 3-vectors, where
NumPy's per-call dispatch overhead dwarfs the arithmetic — `np.cross` alone
spent more time in `normalize_axis_tuple`/`moveaxis` than on the cross product.
The corner UVs are plain `(u, v)` tuples for the same reason.

### The budget must be counted in WELDED nodes
<a id="qem-budget-welded-nodes"></a>

The target handed to `qem_decimate` must be expressed in **welded nodes**,
because that is what the collapse loop counts down. A NIF's vertex array splits
a position once per UV/normal seam: measured across greatforest `_far.nif`,
**310 stored vertices for 62 distinct positions — 5.0x**. So a ratio applied to
the stored count asks for far more geometry than actually exists.

That is what made the far-ring tiers inert. `TIER16`'s ratio of 0.25 against
the stored count worked out to **1.26x the welded count**, so `alive > target`
was false on entry, the loop never ran, and `_far16.nif` was written as a
byte-for-byte copy of `_far.nif`.

## Scoping a LAND scan to one worldspace
<a id="land-scan-scoping"></a>

**Code:** `scan_land_file` in `asset_convert/lod/terrain_lod.py`.

`known_wrld_fid` is the target worldspace's FormID as resolved from the file
that DEFINES it. An override plugin edits a master's worldspace through the
master's GRUPs — its records sit under a type-1 GRUP labelled with the master's
WRLD FormID — while shipping no WRLD record of its own. Passing the master's
FormID in is what lets those edits be scoped correctly instead of falling back
to a wildcard.

`allow_unscoped` decides what "this file has no such WRLD record, and no FormID
was supplied" means:

- **True** (the default, correct for the file the worldspace is sourced FROM)
  keeps the historical fallback: take every LAND record, because a file scanned
  for its own worldspace may name it differently, and returning nothing would
  silently produce no terrain at all.
- **False** is mandatory for OVERLAYS, where the same fallback is a
  data-corruption bug: it imports the plugin's OTHER worldspaces as if they
  were this one. `Morrowind_ob.esm` ships no `TES4Tamriel` WRLD, so all **5,796
  of its Vvardenfell cells** were collected into Cyrodiil's heightmap,
  overwriting **5,787 of Oblivion's own Tamriel cells** and stamping
  Vvardenfell across central Cyrodiil's distant terrain.

A CELL record an override ships carries only the fields its author changed, so
its XCLC grid coords may be absent. Coordinates are resolved against the coords
already learned from earlier files in load order before falling back to this
file's own.

## LODGen rejects poisoned floats, and drops the whole worldspace
<a id="lodgen-poisoned-floats"></a>

**Code:** `finite` in `asset_convert/lod/esm_scan.py`.

LODGen's C# parser rejects a poisoned line and then emits **NO .bto tiles for
the entire worldspace**, so one bad REFR costs all of its object LOD. Two
distinct poisons appear in real plugins, and they fail differently:

| value | formats as | LODGen error |
|---|---|---|
| NaN (`0x7FC00000`) | `nan` | "Input string was not in a correct format" |
| `-FLT_MAX` (`0xFF7FFFFF`) | a 40-digit literal | "Value was either too large or too small for a Single" |

The second is **finite**, so an `isfinite()` check alone lets it straight
through — hence the magnitude bound as well. `_PLACEMENT_LIMIT` is 1e9;
Oblivion's largest worldspace spans ~2e6 units, so a sane coordinate never
comes close.

TWMP Valenwood/Elsweyr ships **505 REFRs** carrying one or the other in DATA's
RotZ. A MASTER's record reaches this parser without passing the import-side
`get_float` clamp, so both screens are needed here too.

## The parsed-ESM cache
<a id="parsed-esm-cache"></a>

**Code:** `parse_esm_cached` in `asset_convert/lod/esm_scan.py`.

`generate_lod()` is called ONCE PER WORLDSPACE and used to re-parse the whole
plugin every time. Oblivion.esm ships 18 worldspaces and the parse is **5.7 s
over 613 MB (1,017,612 refs)**, so ~103 s of the object-LOD stage was spent
re-deriving byte-for-byte identical data.

Keyed on `(path, mtime_ns, size)` so a rebuilt ESM is re-parsed rather than
served stale.

The cache holds the BASE plugin and its OVERLAYS together. It used to keep a
single entry, which made the two uses evict each other: the overlay merge
parses every overlay once per worldspace, so a 1-entry cache serving only the
base still re-parsed ~930 MB of overlays 18 times — **114 s measured on the
12-plugin selection, of which 4 s was useful.**

The bound is the number of plugins in one run (a dozen), not a byte budget:
these are compact index structures, and the raw `bytes` object is released
inside `parse_esm` as soon as the scan finishes.

🔴 The returned structures are treated as **READ-ONLY** by callers.
`write_lodgen_input` builds its own per-worldspace views and `generate_lod`
merges overlays into a COPY. If that ever stops being true this must hand out
deep copies instead — the overlay merge in particular MUST NOT mutate what it
is handed, now that the same object is served to the next worldspace.

### The topology-aware budget
<a id="qem-topology-budget"></a>

A flat share of the vertex count assumes every model simplifies equally well,
and they do not. A rock is one closed blob: **12%** of its vertices sit on an
open rim, so almost every vertex is interior and free to collapse. A building
is a pile of open sheets — `piratecabin01` is **30%** boundary,
`ruinshallnxdeadenda01` **47%** — and those rim vertices are pinned by the
open-rim guard.

Give both the same 5% and the rock lands on a clean silhouette while the
building runs out of collapsible interior and tears itself apart. Measured on
the cabin, open edges went **11.5% (source) → 21% → 43%** as the target dropped
500 → 300 → 54.

So the budget scales by how much of the model is rim:

```
topo_scale   = 1.0 + TOPO_BOUNDARY_WEIGHT * boundary_fraction
total_target = clamp(weld_nodes * ratio * topo_scale, _MIN_TOTAL_TARGET, cap)
```

A mostly-closed model keeps the base ratio; a rim-heavy one gets
proportionally more vertices, which is what it needs to still read as itself.

## The DDS block codec
<a id="dds-block-codec"></a>

**Code:** `asset_convert/lod/dds_codec.py`

Split out of `terrain_lod.py`: nothing in it knows about terrain, every entry
point takes a pixel array and returns bytes.

### <a id="dxt1-is-vectorised-over-blocks"></a>DXT1 is vectorised over blocks

For each 4×4 block the encoder takes the per-channel min and max as the DXT1
endpoints (`c0 > c1`, opaque 4-colour mode) and assigns each pixel the nearest
of the four interpolated colours. The palette is re-expanded **from** 565 — the
scalar version built its palette from `c565_to_rgb` of the quantised endpoints,
and matching that is what keeps the output byte-identical.

A 1024² tile is ~65k blocks, and the old per-block Python loop was the single
hottest function in terrain LOD: **1.4s per LOD16 tile, ~33% of all tile time.**

### <a id="dxt1-chunking-is-a-memory-fix"></a>The nearest-palette search is CHUNKED, and that is not an optimisation

The whole-array form allocates `(N,16,4,3)` for the differences plus an
`(N,16,4)` reduction, and `sum` promotes int32 to int64, so a 1024² tile
(65,536 blocks) transiently needs **~80 MB**. That is survivable alone and fatal
in parallel: with one worker per core, **29 of them peaked together and every
level-16 tile died** on `Unable to allocate 32.0 MiB for an array with shape
(65536, 16, 4)`.

Chunking bounds the peak per worker regardless of tile size, and the explicit
int32 accumulator halves what remains. The squared distance maxes at
`3 × 255² = 195,075`, so int32 cannot overflow.

### <a id="one-dds-header-builder"></a>One header builder, three formats

`dds_header()` writes the 128-byte header for any compressed square texture,
parameterised by FourCC and mip count. DXT1 and BC5 (`ATI2`) previously each
hand-rolled the same layout — three copies, with the field names repeated as
comments in each. The layout, in order: magic, `dwSize`, `dwFlags`,
`dwHeight`, `dwWidth`, `dwPitchOrLinearSize` (the TOP mip), `dwDepth`,
`dwMipMapCount`, `dwReserved1[11]`, the 32-byte pixel format (size, flags,
FourCC, five unused masks), `dwCaps`, and four trailing reserved words.

Mipmaps run down to 1×1, as vanilla Skyrim terrain LOD DDS files do. Tile size
matches vanilla per LOD level: 1024 for LOD4/8, 2048 for LOD16/32.
