# FO3/FNV export deltas

**Code:** `tes4_export/record_types/falloutnv.py`, `tes4_export/tes4_reader.py`

Why a Fallout plugin needs its own delta module, and why the field list is
shorter than a signature census predicts.

## The header size is per-file, not a constant

FO3/FNV record headers are 24 bytes against Oblivion's 20, and **the GRUP header
scales with them**. An early note claimed `GROUP_HEADER_SIZE` was fixed at 20 in
both games; that was wrong, and came from a test that set the group size to 24
for *both*, which corrupted the Oblivion parse (63 types collapsed to 31). The
measurement that settles it: an FO3/FNV GRUP's first record signature sits at
+24, Oblivion's at +20.

`detect_header_size` probes both offsets for the `HEDR` literal rather than
trusting a version float, then one detected size drives both headers. Across 60
real plugins the split is unambiguous — 5 TES4 files report HEDR 1.00 at offset
20, and 55 FNV/FO3 files report 1.32-1.34 at offset 24.

`_format_chunk_worker` re-detects from its own mmap instead of receiving the size
in its args tuple. `ProcessPoolExecutor` runs with no initializer, so on Windows
spawn a module global set in the parent never reaches the worker; detecting
locally sidesteps the problem without widening the args tuple.

## A shared signature is not a shared field

The subrecord census that motivated this work compared signature presence and
frequency. That is necessary but not sufficient, and three fields prove it.

**`XCLC` is 12 bytes in FO3/FNV, 8 in TES4** — X, Y, then a land-flags byte and
3 unused. `export_CELL` reads X and Y at offsets 0 and 4 behind a `>= 8` guard,
so it was already correct for both; only the flags byte is new.

**`XCLL` is 40 bytes against TES4's 36.** The extra trailing float is Fog Power.
Everything before it is positionally identical, so the existing reader is safe
and only the tail needed adding.

**`LNAM` looks like a passthrough and is not.** In FO3/FNV it is a `U32` of
lighting-inherit flags; in Skyrim it is `wbByteArray(LNAM, 'Unknown', 0,
cpIgnore)` — leftover, ignored, with the real flags moved into `XCLC`. It is
dropped rather than passed through.

## Format-identical fields whose referents do not exist

The 14.4% "Skyrim-native passthrough" bucket is right about layout and wrong
about five CELL fields. `LTMP`, `XCAS`, `XCIM`, `XCMO` and `XEZN` are byte-for
byte the same in FNV and Skyrim per xEdit, but every one is a FormID pointing at
a record type this converter does not emit:

| Field | Points at | Resolved in FalloutNV.esm |
|---|---|---|
| `LTMP` | `LGTM` | 273 real + 30,224 null |
| `XCAS` | `ASPC` | 17,485 |
| `XCIM` | `IMGS` | 321 |
| `XCMO` | `MUSC` | 297 |
| `XEZN` | `ECZN` | 84 |

None of `LGTM`, `ASPC`, `IMGS`, `MUSC` or `ECZN` is in `IMPORT_DISPATCH`.
Passing these through writes dangling FormIDs, which is a rejection the CK
reports as a broken reference rather than a bad value. They drop until their
target types convert.

`XNAM` survives the same test: FNV and Skyrim both define it as
`wbString(XNAM, 'Water Noise Texture')`, and it carries no FormID. 30,458 of
30,495 are a 1-byte empty string; 36 carry real 35-47 byte paths.

## Measured field coverage

From `FalloutNV.esm` (Tale of Two Wastelands merge), 465,054 records parsed
through the shipped reader:

| Type | Records | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `REFR` | 307,710 | `NAME`+`DATA`+`XSCL` = 89% of 816k subrecords |
| `CELL` | 30,497 | `DATA`/`LNAM`/`LTMP`/`XCLW` fire on every record |
| `LAND` | 29,363 | 7 subrecord types, all TES4-known |
| `STAT` | 6,795 | `OBND` on all; `BRUS` (3,414) drops |
| `ACHR` | 3,386 | |
| `ACRE` | 2,999 | |
| `DOOR` | 320 | `OBND` on all |
| `WRLD` | 14 | |

`LAND` needs no delta handling at all — every one of its 7 subrecord signatures
is one Oblivion also emits, at the same size.

## Fallout-only base objects

FO3/FNV place references against base-object types Oblivion does not have. The
records are skipped, but the REFRs that point at them are not — so the base
resolves to null and the engine faults dereferencing it. The measured crash:
`EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` reading `[rcx+0x1A]` with `rcx = 0` inside
`QueuedPromoteLocationReferencesTask`, while promoting a persistent REFR into
`BGSLocation \"Mojave Wasteland\"`.

Measured in the first FalloutNV output: **721 base objects, 11,722 references**
with no record behind them. Oblivion's output has 6 such targets, all of them
deliberate Skyrim.esm marker references (`XMarker`, `XMarkerHeading`,
`NorthMarker`, `MapMarker`, `Gold001`), which resolve through the master.

| Type | Bases | Refs | Converted as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MSTT` movable static | 224 | 7,823 | STAT |
| `TERM` terminal | 171 | 219 | ACTI |
| `IDLM` idle marker | 98 | 1,424 | STAT |
| `SCOL` static collection | 83 | 1,084 | STAT |
| `NOTE` note | 51 | 54 | ACTI |
| `ASPC` acoustic space | 32 | 49 | STAT |
| `TACT` talking activator | 31 | 43 | ACTI |
| `PWAT` placeable water | 28 | 102 | STAT |

Every one carries `MODL` and `OBND`, which is all a Skyrim STAT needs; the
named, scriptable ones (`TERM`, `NOTE`, `TACT`) additionally carry `FULL`
and a script, making them ACTI. `SCOL` loses its `ONAM` part list and renders
as the collection's own model rather than its instanced pieces.


## LTEX moved its texture to a TXST

Oblivion names a landscape texture directly on `LTEX.ICON`. FO3/FNV keep
`ICON` in the record definition but do not use it: the texture is a `TNAM`
FormID pointing at a `TXST` record, whose `TX00` holds the diffuse path.
xEdit's FNV definition declares both, and the shipped data settles which is live.

All 89 of FalloutNV.esm's LTEX records carry a `TNAM` and **zero** carry an
`ICON`, so an ICON-only exporter emits no texture at all and the terrain
renders black or falls back to the Skyrim default.

`index_texture_sets` indexes the 495 TXST records that carry a `TX00`, and
`ltex_icon_path` resolves `TNAM` through it. The TX00 paths are spelled
`Landscape\Asphalt02.dds`, while `convert_LTEX` prepends
`landscape\` itself (Oblivion's ICON convention is relative to that
folder), so the prefix is stripped on the way out rather than teaching the
importer a second form.

## Weapons: guns become crossbows

**Code:** `tes4_export/record_types/falloutnv.py` (`_emit_weap_deltas`),
`tes5_import/record_types/equipment.py` (`convert_WEAP`)

### The defect

The FO3/FNV WEAP layout differs from TES4's, so the shared exporter dumped
none of it. Measured over `export/FalloutNV.esm/WEAP.txt`: **265 weapons, 0
carrying `DATA.Type`** — only EDID, FULL, MODL, ICON and OBND survived.

With no type, `WEAPON_TYPE_MAP.get(tes4_type, 1)` fell to its default of **1 =
Sword**, so every gun in the game arrived as a one-handed blade with no damage,
value, weight or reach.

### Where the fields live

TES4 packs everything into one 30-byte `DATA`. FO3/FNV split it:

| Field | FO3/FNV | TES4 |
|---|---|---|
| Animation Type | `DNAM` +0 (u32) | `DATA` +0 |
| Animation Multiplier (speed) | `DNAM` +4 (f32) | `DATA` +4 |
| Reach | `DNAM` +8 (f32) | `DATA` +8 |
| Value | `DATA` +0 (s32) | `DATA` +16 |
| Health | `DATA` +4 (s32) | `DATA` +20 |
| Weight | `DATA` +8 (f32) | `DATA` +24 |
| Base Damage | `DATA` +12 (s16) | `DATA` +28 (u16) |
| Clip Size | `DATA` +14 (u8) | — |

The exporter emits the **TES4 key names**, so the importer needs no new
vocabulary for any of the shared fields.

### The animation mapping

FO3/FNV has 14 weapon animation types (`wbWeaponAnimTypeEnum`,
`Core/wbDefinitionsFNV.pas:2901`); Skyrim has 10
(`Core/wbDefinitionsTES5.pas:2718`). Skyrim's only ranged animations are
**Bow (7)** and **Crossbow (9)**, so every firearm maps to Crossbow — it aims
and fires a projectile flat, where a bow is drawn and arced.

| FO3/FNV | | → Skyrim |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Hand to Hand | HandToHandMelee (0) |
| 1 | Melee 1 Hand | OneHandSword (1) |
| 2 | Melee 2 Hand | TwoHandSword (5) |
| 3, 4 | Pistol — Ballistic / Energy | Crossbow (9) |
| 5, 6, 7 | Rifle — Ballistic / Automatic / Energy | Crossbow (9) |
| 8 | Handle (2 Hand) | TwoHandSword (5) |
| 9 | Launcher (2 Hand) | Crossbow (9) |
| 10–13 | Grenade / mine / thrown | Crossbow (9) |

Types 10–13 have no Skyrim equivalent at all — a thrown grenade is not an
animation the engine has. They take Crossbow so they remain usable ranged
weapons rather than becoming swords.

`DNAM.FalloutAnimType` carries the raw value through so the importer can tell a
pistol from a rifle; the exporter also writes a TES4-equivalent `DATA.Type` so
every existing code path keeps working unchanged.

### Reload animation

A converted gun reloads with the crossbow's crank animation. Skyrim has no
other ranged reload, and this is cosmetic — the weapon fires correctly.

## Navmesh: authored, not generated

**Code:** `tes4_export/record_types/falloutnv.py` (`_emit_navm_deltas`,
`_emit_navi_deltas`), `tes5_import/record_types/navm_falloutnv.py`

### Why FO3/FNV needs a different path

Oblivion has no navmesh. It ships **pathgrids** (PGRD), and the importer
*generates* navmesh geometry from them — the slowest stage in the pipeline, and
the reason the shared navmesh cache exists.

FO3/FNV ship real navmeshes. Measured:

| | PGRD | NAVM | NAVI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Oblivion.esm | 8,228 | 0 | 0 |
| FalloutNV.esm | **0** | **4,771** | **1** |

So FalloutNV got no navmesh at all: nothing to generate from, and its authored
navmeshes were never read. Symptom: NPCs cannot path anywhere.

This is a **read-and-repack**, not a generation problem, so it needs none of
the pathgrid machinery and none of the cache.

### The format gap

FO3/FNV spread the navmesh across separate subrecords; TES5 packs the whole
thing into one `NVNM` blob.

| | FO3/FNV | TES5 |
|---|---|---|
| Cell + counts | `DATA` (24B) | inside `NVNM` |
| Vertices | `NVVX`, 12B each | inside `NVNM` |
| Triangles | `NVTR`, 16B each | inside `NVNM` |
| Door links | `NVDP`, 8B each | inside `NVNM` |
| Grid | `NVGD` | rebuilt |
| Cover triangles | `NVCA` | dropped — Skyrim has no cover system |

The triangle record is the same shape in both: three u16 vertex indices, three
s16 edge-adjacency indices, then flags. **FO3/FNV already store the edge
adjacency**, so the importer skips `_compute_adjacency` entirely — the authored
answer is better than a recomputed one, and cheaper.

`NVGD` is not exported: it is a spatial lookup grid derived from the geometry,
and `_pack_nvnm` builds its own via `_build_navmesh_grid`.

### What the exporter emits

`NVVX`, `NVTR` and `NVDP` are dumped verbatim as hex; `DATA` is unpacked into
named fields. NAVI's repeating `NVMI` entries are emitted one per line with an
ordinal plus a count, since a single record carries thousands.

### Reusing the TES5 serialiser

`tes5_import/pgrd_to_navm.py::_pack_nvnm` already writes the TES5 blob and is
validated byte-exact against real Skyrim navmeshes. It takes
`(verts, tris, adj, tri_flags, ...)` — exactly what NVVX/NVTR carry — so the
FO3/FNV path feeds it authored data where the Oblivion path feeds it generated
data. One serialiser, two sources.

### Authored edges that name no triangle

Vanilla FalloutNV.esm has **43 edge-adjacency entries across 38 navmeshes**
that index past the last triangle in their own mesh -- 43 of 674,700, a 0.006%
defect rate in Bethesda's own data. The first is navmesh 00124991, whose edge
names triangle 6 in a 6-triangle mesh.

FO3/FNV otherwise use -1 for no" "neighbour exactly as TES5 does (251,745
occurrences). parse_triangles normalizes an out-of-range edge to -1, because
navm_split._components indexes comp[e] directly and only guards against -1;
an unchecked value raises IndexError and kills the whole import.

## Marker base objects
<a id="marker-base-objects"></a>

**Code:** `tes5_import/record_types/world_falloutnv.py`

FO3/FNV ship their editor markers as ordinary `STAT` records with real meshes
(`MarkerX.nif`, `Marker_Audio.NIF`, `Markers\FurnitureMarker01.NIF`). The engine
hides them by convention; Skyrim has no such rule, so they convert into fully
visible statics scattered through every interior.

`TES4_MARKER_FORMID_TO_SKYRIM` already substitutes Skyrim.esm's invisible
markers for the ones FO3/FNV share with Oblivion -- XMarker `0x3B`,
XMarkerHeading `0x34`, MapMarker `0x10`, NorthMarker `0x03` all keep their
Oblivion FormIDs. Six do not, counted from `export/FalloutNV.esm/REFR.txt`:

| EditorID | FormID | REFRs |
|---|---|---:|
| CollisionMarker | `0x21` | 2,761 |
| RoomMarker | `0x1F` | 679 |
| AudioMarker | `0x23` | 577 |
| COCMarkerHeading | `0x32` | 135 |
| RadiationMarker | `0x33` | 119 |
| MultiBoundMarker | `0x15` | 2 |

4,273 references in all, `CollisionMarker` alone accounting for two thirds and
concentrated in interiors.

🛑 **These must never be merged into the shared TES4 table.** FO3/FNV reuse the
low FormID space Oblivion fills with real content -- measured in both
Oblivion.esm and Nehrim.esm:

| FormID | FO3/FNV | Oblivion / Nehrim |
|---|---|---|
| `0x15` | MultiBoundMarker | `CLOT` JailPants |
| `0x1F` | RoomMarker | `STAT` FlameNode1 |
| `0x21` | CollisionMarker | `STAT` FlameNode3 |
| `0x23` | AudioMarker | `STAT` FlameNode5 |

Merging the two tables would turn Oblivion's flame nodes and a pair of trousers
invisible. The FO3/FNV table is selected per source instead.

## <a id="fnv-biped-slots"></a>FNV biped slots

FO3/FNV `BMDT.BipedFlags` is a **20-bit** field (`itU32`); Oblivion's is
**16-bit** (`itU16`), and the two share only bits 0-2. From bit 3 they mean
entirely different things, so reading FNV flags through `BIPED_SLOT_MAP`
silently puts armor in the wrong slot rather than failing.

| Bit | FNV | Oblivion | Skyrim slot chosen |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 3 | Left Hand | Lower Body | 33-Hands |
| 4 | Right Hand | Hand | 33-Hands |
| 5 | Weapon | Foot | *dropped — not a wearable slot* |
| 6 | PipBoy | Right Ring | 34-Forearms |
| 7 | Backpack | Left Ring | 46-Unnamed |
| 8 | Necklace | Amulet | 35-Amulet |
| 9 | Headband | Weapon | 42-Circlet |
| 10 | Hat | Back Weapon | 31-Hair |
| 11 | Eye Glasses | Side Weapon | 42-Circlet |
| 12 | Nose Ring | Quiver | 43-Ears |
| 13 | Earrings | Shield | 43-Ears |
| 14 | Mask | Torch | 30-Head |
| 15 | Choker | Tail | 35-Amulet |
| 16-19 | Mouth Object, Body AddOn 1-3 | — | 43-Ears, 47-49 |

Censused over all 393 FNV ARMO records, the bits actually authored and what
the Oblivion table made of them:

| Bit | Records | FNV meaning | Was read as |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 9 | 131 | Headband | Weapon |
| 10 | 104 | Hat | Back Weapon |
| 14 | 57 | Mask | Torch |
| 11 | 33 | Eye Glasses | Side Weapon |
| 2 | 231 | Upper Body | Upper Body (correct) |
| 1 | 87 | Hair | Hair (correct) |
| 0 | 18 | Head | Head (correct) |

So 325 of 393 head-and-face items were landing in weapon slots. Only bits
0-2 (336 records) were ever right.

Several FNV slots collapse onto one Skyrim slot because Skyrim has no
equivalent: both hands share 33-Hands, and the four head-accessory bits
distribute across Circlet/Ears/Head by where the item actually sits. Weapon
(bit 5) is dropped outright — an ARMO occupying it would block the weapon.
