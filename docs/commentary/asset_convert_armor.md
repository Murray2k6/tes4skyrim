## NIF worn armor conversion
<a id="nif-worn-armor-conversion"></a>
- Worn armor (has_skin AND not _gnd AND in armor/clothes dir) must use **NiNode** root, NOT BSFadeNode
- BSFadeNode is for world objects only — worn armor is attached to the character skeleton
- BSDismemberSkinInstance is required for Skyrim biped slot assignment (upgrade from NiSkinInstance)
- Ground models (_gnd) with cloth-physics bones must have skin stripped (bones don't exist in Skyrim skeleton)
- **Material CRC (unknown_int_2)**: ALL vanilla Skyrim NiTriShapeData has `unknown_int_2=0`. This field is the Material CRC in Skyrim BSStream 83. Setting it to 8 (confused with the tangent flags) causes rendering issues. Always set to 0.
- **PRN rigid armor (helmets etc.)**: Oblivion attaches via `Prn` NiStringExtraData on root. Converted to BSDismemberSkinInstance with single bone at weight 1.0. Vanilla Skyrim structure has bone NiNode as FIRST child of root (before geometry blocks). bodyPart=131 (SBP_131_HAIR) is correct for helmets (they replace hair).
- **PRN piece verts are in an upright bone-pivot frame** (same convention as vanilla Skyrim head-local helmet verts), NOT in the rotated Bip01 bone frame — no rotation correction needed; the retarget places them exactly at the SK bone. Therefore the FK-tuned `ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS` (helmet dz=+7, tuned on genuinely-skinned helms like TownguardCho) must NOT apply to them — that floated iron/legion helms on top of the head. PRN blocks are collected via `retarget_skin_to_skyrim(prn_out=...)` and get `ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS_PRN` instead (helmet dz=-2.1: OB head pivot sits deeper in the skull — OB headhuman.nif top = pivot+13.6 vs SK malehead.nif +11.5).
- **Body part assignment (BSDismemberSkinInstance)**: Oblivion cuirass NIFs have geometry named 'Arms' and 'UpperBody'. The 'arm' keyword in ARMOR_GEOMETRY_BODY_PARTS maps to SBP_32_BODY (not SBP_34_FOREARMS) because gauntlet NIFs use 'Hand' geometry names — 'Arms' only appears in cuirass/shirt meshes. This prevents cuirass arm geometry from being hidden when gauntlets are equipped.
- **Clothing vs armor ARMA body coverage**: Clothing ARMA should NOT add ForeArms(34) extra coverage — shirt sleeves (SBP_32_BODY) should remain visible when gloves are equipped. Armor cuirasses DO add ForeArms(34) because the separate ARMA system allows gauntlets to properly overlay.
- **Shoes vs boots calves slot**: Shoes (clogs, sandals) should NOT claim Calves(38) in ARMA. Only boots get calves. Detection: `'boot' in model_path`. Clothing foot items without 'boot' are shoes.
- **Oblivion alpha-BLENDS surfaces it also alpha-TESTS; Skyrim must not (fixed 2026-07-27, `_skyrim_alpha_property`)**: Oblivion ships cutout geometry as `NiAlphaProperty` flags **0x12ED** (blend bit 0 SET + test bit 9 set). Skyrim reads the blend bit as "draw in the transparent pass", so an opaque diffuse authored that way renders wrong — this is why the **Shivering Isles Dark Seducer body armor was invisible when worn while its ground model was fine** (SI armor is one all-in-one ARMO covering slots 32/33/37/44; its `armor.dds` is DXT3 but **99.5% fully opaque**, so it should be a plain cutout). Vanilla uses **0x12EC** — the identical value with blending CLEAR — on **188/193** surveyed shapes that enable alpha testing (`references/Skyrim Meshes` armor + landscape + architecture + clutter). So whenever the test bit is on, the blend bit is dropped. This is a GENERAL TES4→TES5 rule, not an SI quirk; `grass_profile.py` had already learned the same thing for grass (`0x12ED`→blend clear) and this generalises it to every converted mesh.
- **Blend-on/test-OFF is real transparency EXCEPT under `APPLY_HILIGHT2` (fixed 2026-07-27)**: see-through SI mania/dementia rocks ship `0x00ED` (blend on, test off) — but so do gems, bottles, curtains, posters and potion liquids, which must keep blending, and a flawed emerald has *byte-identical* alpha flags to a rock overlay. The discriminator is **`NiTexturingProperty.apply_mode`**: the rocks use **APPLY_HILIGHT2 (4)**, which is Oblivion's **parallax** switch — that alpha is a HEIGHT FIELD, not transparency and not a blend weight (see the parallax section; the mid-tone-dominant profile the census measured is exactly a height map's) (SI `DMRockSideRoot01.dds`: 0% opaque / 99% partial). Skyrim has no equivalent mode, so it blends the mask across the whole surface → you see through the rock. Census over ~1,000 source meshes (rocks, clutter, architecture, dungeons, plants): **all 5** blend-on HILIGHT2 shapes are the SI rock overlays; **none** of the other 142 blend-on shapes use HILIGHT2 (they are MODULATE=2 or HILIGHT=3). Everything else is left exactly as authored. Do NOT try to classify these by texture alpha percentages — potion liquids measure 100% partial alpha and would be wrongly turned opaque.
  - **The remedy is to DROP the NiAlphaProperty (`hilight2_alpha_dropped`), not to reinterpret it.** Two earlier attempts are recorded because neither is in the code and both are worth not repeating: the first version of this fix turned HILIGHT2+blend+no-test into a threshold-128 cutout, which replaced see-through rock with **completely invisible sections** — these overlay masks are soft gradients with NO fully-opaque texels at all, so a cutout deletes a quarter to a half of the surface outright (`DMRockSideRoot01` peaks at alpha **221** with 29% of texels below 128; `DMRockSideMudBase01` peaks at 238, 26% below; `mrock01worn` 47% below). The second attempt was `slsf_1_decal` + `slsf_1_dynamic_decal` with blending KEPT. 🛑 **Neither shipped** — grep for `slsf_1_decal` or `0x10ED` in `nif_converter.py` and you will find nothing; `process_geometry` drops a blend-enabled NiAlphaProperty under HILIGHT2 outright and the rock renders solid. Vanilla census (400 random meshes, all block types): blend-on/test-off is a perfectly legal Skyrim mode (370 shapes), and **142/206 blend-on shapes carrying the decal pair all ship alpha flags exactly `0x10ED`** — Oblivion's own `0x00ED` plus the no-sort bit `0x1000`. Vanilla agrees with the drop: across 600 landscape/clutter meshes, 1088/1313 shapes ship no NiAlphaProperty at all and the commonest value on the rest is `0x12EC` (test, blend OFF). Vanilla rock does not alpha-blend.
  - **The same overlay breaks OBJECT LOD even with NO alpha property at all (fixed 2026-08-20)**: the two fixes above both hang off `alpha_prop is not None`, so a HILIGHT2 shape that ships no `NiAlphaProperty` was untouched — correct up close (nothing samples the channel) but see-through at LOD range. `RockGreatForest645` is the reference case: `apply_mode=4`, no alpha property, and its diffuses `GreatForestRock03/01.dds` measure alpha mean 101.6/157.2 with only 0.5%/0.0% of texels fully opaque — a blend WEIGHT, not a mask. Cause: LODGen stamps `slsf_2_lod_objects` on every shape it bakes (`num2 = 5U` in `LODApp.cs`), and the LOD object shader reads diffuse alpha as opacity. Confirmed in the artifacts — `TES4Tamriel.4.4.-12.bto` has 13 shapes and **zero** `NiAlphaProperty` blocks, and 154 shapes across 75 sampled VANILLA `.bto` tiles carry zero between them: vanilla object LOD is opaque, always.
    - LODGen cannot be told otherwise — it writes the shader itself, and it only harvests `NiAlphaProperty` in its `fo4`/`merge5` modes (`ShapeDesc.cs:369`), never the `tes5`/`sse` mode we run, so `isAlpha` stays false and the emit path writes `SetBSProperty(1, -1)`.
    - The texture cannot be flattened in place either — **unless `--parallax` carried the height out to a `_p.dds` first**, which is the one case where the full mesh no longer needs that channel (the height then lives in slot 3, where Skyrim's shader actually reads it). Without `--parallax`, or for a texture the height classifier rejects (92 of Nehrim's 130 flagged diffuses hold no usable height), the full-size mesh still needs the alpha. So mesh conversion records every HILIGHT2 diffuse to `export/<plugin>/overlay_diffuses.txt` (`texture_prune.OVERLAY_MANIFEST_NAME`) and `lod_gen._force_opaque_lod_diffuses` writes an alpha-flattened COPY into the LOD mod's texture tree at the same relative path the tiles reference. Data holds one file per path and that tree shadows the plugins', so tiles get the opaque copy and full meshes keep theirs.
    - **The discriminator is the AUTHORED `apply_mode`, never the pixels.** A genuine cutout mask ships MODULATE (2), is absent from the manifest, and is left alone. Measuring alpha instead flattens tree billboards and cobwebs into solid rectangles — DXT5 leaves a billboard with ~0% of texels at exactly 255 even though it is unambiguously a mask. (Same trap the bullet above warns about for potion liquids.) Measured: 94 overlay diffuses across the 4 Tamriel contributors; `cobweb01.nif` (MODULATE) correctly reports none.
- **Body skin splice section_bboxes coordinate space**: OB body skin sections are in OB skeleton space; SK body NIF verts are in SK skeleton space. These are DIFFERENT frames. The OB arm area (z≈98–105) is at SK z≈72–92 after retarget. **Always use POST-RETARGET section_bboxes** from `collect_skin_info()` — these are in SK world space and correctly localise both arm openings and neck. Pre-retarget bboxes (source OB verts) only work for neck/collar (small-x geometry that happens to be at the same world z in both skeletons) but MISS the arms (which are displaced ~20 Z units by skeleton frame differences). SK male body max arm reach (|x|>20) sits at z=75–97 world, exactly within the post-retarget 'Arms' bbox z=72–92. Use `bbox_pad=1.0` to stay under 25% of total body verts spliced.

## Body-wrap armor fitting (2026-07-10/11, `asset_convert/character/body_wrap.py`)
<a id="body-wrap-armor-fitting"></a>
- **Architecture: FK base + measured-error correction field.** FK (animation DQS) is locally smooth but lands armor 0.5-2.5 units off the SK body (the in-game clipping). The wrap field measures FK's error EXACTLY by running the actual OB body meshes (upperbody/lowerbody/hand/foot) through the very same FK retarget, then fitting them onto the real Skyrim body NIFs via iterative closest-point projection with topology-aware delta smoothing (never bleeds between the legs) + limb-segment length prescaling. Fits BOTH weight-slider targets (`malebody_0` AND `malebody_1` etc.); cached per gender in `generated/body_wrap_{male,female}.npz` (src/fkp/dst0/dst1/tris/vert_bc/part). Runtime: FK first, then each armor vertex gets `delta = dst[w] - fkp` interpolated from the K=40 nearest body triangles (Gaussian distance + skin-weight bone-centroid gating + wrong-side penalty), then a clearance-enforcement push. Rebuild with `python -m asset_convert.character.body_wrap` (uses `allow_wrap=False` internally -- the field must never bootstrap from a previous field).
- **_0/_1 weight variants (2026-07-11)**: `convert_nif` writes `<name>_0.nif`/`<name>_1.nif` for every biped wearable (any non-`_gnd` mesh the wearable plan names — see the folder-vs-plugin note below). **The _1 file is NEVER a second independent conversion** — the engine lerps the pair per-vertex, so the pair must be topology-identical; a reconversion clips the body splice differently and mid-slider values vertex-explode (observed in game). Instead `body_wrap.morph_converted_to_weight1` post-morphs the finished _0 mesh with the fitted `dst1 - dst0` body morph (built from the REFERENCE Skyrim bodies — the modified output bodies have bugs and are never used for weights); spliced fill lies on the _0 surface so it gets the exact body morph, rigid PRN blocks are untouched. tes5_import ARMA enables the weight slider + `<name>_1.nif` path ONLY for gear covering TES4 biped bits 2-5 (upper/lower body, hand, foot) — vanilla helmets (IronHelmetAA) and shields (IronShieldAA) have the slider DISABLED and a plain path, and slider-on shields misbehaved in game.
- **What counts as worn gear is the PLUGIN's call, not the folder's (2026-08-08)**: `_convert_nif` used to decide with `'armor' in src_path or 'clothes' in src_path`. That holds for vanilla Oblivion, which files every wearable under `meshes\armor` or `meshes\clothes`, but it is a guess about a naming convention. Nehrim files 88 worn meshes under its own folders (`eyren/`, `spinat/`, `nehrim/`, `skeletonk/`, `dwemertechnology/`, `ttbeards/`, `mr_siika/`, `suedland_set/`) and every one of them was converted as a **world object**: BSFadeNode root instead of NiNode, plain NiSkinInstance instead of BSDismemberSkinInstance, no retarget onto the Skyrim skeleton — and, because the same substring gated the variant writer, no `_0`/`_1` pair, so 52 of the 61 unresolvable ARMA paths were simply never written and the engine drew nothing (guards with a head and hands but no torso). The authored answer is the plugin's own biped model references: `wearable_plan` now sets a `WORN` bit on every path an ARMO/CLOT names as a biped model, and `wearable_plan.is_worn` answers the question. The folder test survives only as the fallback for meshes no record references. Verified byte-identical output for `armor/` and `clothes/` controls (mesh conversion is **not reproducible across processes** unless `PYTHONHASHSEED` is fixed — set/dict iteration order leaks into the written bytes, so any A/B of NIF output must pin it). The remaining 9 misses are dead references: those meshes exist in no Nehrim BSA and no loose file, i.e. they were broken in the original game too.
- **🔴 Body-skin identity comes from the BONES, not the texture name (2026-08-09)**: Oblivion bakes the wearer's skin into a wearable; the converter strips it and splices Skyrim body geometry back, choosing which body NIF by a keyword in the texture path (`_SKIN_TEX_TO_BODY_NIF`). That is the author's *label*, not what the geometry *is*. Nehrim ships 18 wearables whose torso skin carries a foot or hand texture — the Silverlight cuirass (`Foot:Body`, 3321 verts, weighted to Spine/Spine1/Spine2/Clavicle/Neck/Pelvis, textured `characters\imperial\female\footfemale.dds`) and the entire female Eyren set (four battledresses at 3321 verts plus four greaves). The keyword picked `femalefeet_0.nif`, which contains no torso, so the stripped chest was never spliced back: the armour renders as plates with see-through gaps and the actor looks half-invisible rather than naked. `collect_skin_info` now overrides a hands/feet classification when the skin instance is weighted to **spine, clavicle or neck**. Those three are deliberately the only test — a gauntlet legitimately reaches the forearm and a boot the calf, so including those bones produced 9 false positives on correctly-named vanilla gauntlets; spine/clavicle/neck produced zero. Survey any plugin with `python tools/body_skin_audit.py [plugin] [--all]`. **Diagnostic trap:** the symptom reads as a texture or alpha problem — the source NIF genuinely does have `NiAlphaProperty flags=0x00ed blend=True` on several shapes — so it invites an alpha investigation. Compare the source's shape list against the converted one first; a missing body shape is instantly visible and the alpha is a red herring.
- **Cross-block solve is mandatory**: `deform_geoms_wrap` concatenates ALL non-PRN blocks into ONE weld/correction/diffusion system. Per-block solving gave coincident seam verts across blocks (cuirass/pauldron boundary) different corrections — visible seam splits. `weld_groups` is true distance welding (KDTree pairs + union-find), not grid rounding (rounding-boundary twins split).
- **Head gear (hair, Prn helmets, AND skinned helmets/hoods) is fitted by `asset_convert/character/head_fit.py`'s scalp displacement field (v3, 2026-08-24, after two in-game round trips)**: rigid head gear's verts are **bone-local (face-space)** while the wrap field lives in world space, so a field query for them lands on nothing. The v1 fit oversized every mesh in game — its affine carrier was measured from a WORLD-frame ICP fit and claimed sx 1.18 / sz 1.24; the x was ICP stretching the earless OB head over the SK EARS, the z conflated bone placement with head size. **Measured in head-LOCAL frames the two human skulls are the SAME width (OB x ±5.59, SK ±5.51 male / ±5.58 female earless) with local scalp deltas of only mean 0.96 / max 2.8** (crown ~2 DOWN, occiput/nape ~2-3.4 further back). Vanilla SK head parts (hair01.nif etc.) are stored head-bone-local, same convention as our output. NEVER fit a carrier in world frames.
  - **The v3 mechanism — one smooth scalp-to-scalp displacement field, sampled per vertex.** At BUILD (`build_arrays`, run by `python -m asset_convert.character.body_wrap`): for every OB head vertex, where its matching SK skin point is. Init = NEAREST POINT from the identity carrier; then FIELD_CYCLES of graph smoothing + reprojection ALONG THE OB VERTEX NORMALS (`_project_ray` — nearest-point reprojection exits sideways from inside the SK nape bulge; normal rays reach it and cannot drift laterally). The final step is a projection, so **every field target lies exactly ON the SK skin**. At RUNTIME (`fit_head_gear`/`field_deltas`): each vertex samples the field at its closest scalp point (Gaussian blend that widens with standoff — exact on the skin, smooth far off), so by construction: a vertex ON the skin lands ON the new skin (hairline edges exactly at the skin line), a vertex N units off stays exactly N off (helmets keep authored standoff), and everything over one scalp region moves identically (headbands/eye-coverings never stretch; the only deformation is the real anatomy gradient). Verts >4 units off (ponytails, domes) take their deltas by graph DIFFUSION from the near verts — per-vertex re-sampling at range measured 19% edge stretch on the lengthened style01 tail; diffusion restores 0%. Sweep over all 57 hairs x genders + every PRN helmet (164 meshes): flush err mean 0.05-0.08 / p95 <=0.25, |dlen| p99 <=1.0 human.
  - **Landmark ground truth (measured on the raw local-frame meshes)**: scalps SAME width, but the SK jaw/cheek is 1-1.6 WIDER per side (OB max|x| 3.0-4.5 vs SK 4.6-5.4 band-by-band), the SK nose tip and crown sit 2.1 LOWER, the occiput/nape 2-3.5 further BACK, and the under-occiput hollow and lip profiles differ by ~3 at fixed heights. So converted gear legitimately widens at cheek guards and deepens at the nape — that is flush-to-skin, not oversizing.
  - **The FaceGen UV correspondence is an ICP SEED, never a field init.** Tried and REJECTED for v3: the two layouts' v-coordinates differ by up to 0.042 at the same landmark (back of head OB v 0.506 vs SK 0.464), which read as a systematic ~2-unit downward drag on top of the real anatomy (field dz mean -3.9 vs a measured landmark shift of -2.1) — and vanilla SK helmets sit at the same local heights as OB ones, so the drag is parameterization bias, not anatomy.
  - **The OB head's INTERIOR geometry (mouth bag, inner structures) is excluded from the field domain** (`_visible_exterior`, radial occlusion test): its correspondences form +-3-unit dipoles (bag maps forward onto the lips, inner column backward onto the skull) that tore 4.9-unit edge strain into face-covering masks (darkbrotherhood cowl). Interior verts get their dv in-filled from the exterior field.
  - **EARS ARE IGNORED BY FLATTENING, NOT BY CUTTING.** The OB heads are earless by authoring (ears ship separately) but carry a recessed ear SOCKET; SK heads bake ears in. v2 cut the SK ear triangles — the HOLE's rim attracted every nearby projection ~2 units OUTWARD (iron helm x +2.8, nose guards stretched) and sampling jumped across it. v3 instead projects the SK ear verts onto the carrier-aligned OB socket (`_flatten_ears`): the surface stays continuous, the ear region behaves exactly as the OB socket, gear follows the skull, and SK ears may poke through hair sides exactly as vanilla hair allows.
  - **No orc pack**: Skyrim orcs use the shared human head, the OB orc SCALP is within 0.36 mean of the human one, and a headorc pack measured the worst distortion of any race. Khajiit/argonian keep their packs (SK ships their heads; the SK khajiit skull genuinely is wider, scalp band ±6.74 vs OB ±5.53). All other races (wood elf, high elf...) share malehead/femalehead — censused over all 766 vanilla HDPTs; race size is the skeleton height scale, which scales hair with the head.
  - **Frames**: face space ↔ world via `hf_o_ob` = Bip01 Head world translation and `hf_o_sk` = NPC Head [Head] world translation; Prn gear renders at `verts + o_sk`. Hair is fitted in `hair_pipeline.bake_hair_variant`; helmet Prn blocks in `nif_converter._fit_prn_head_blocks`. Data = `hf_*`/`hfr_*` arrays in the wrap npz, marker `hf_v4` (the loader refuses a stale npz).
  - 🛑 **EVERY in-game head is malehead/femalehead PLUS its RACE's races-tri morph — the base mesh is worn by NO ONE** (measured scalp deltas of `maleheadraces.tri`, names = RACE EditorIDs: elves 2.6, Orc 1.5, all five human races + Dremora <= 0.15 = the base scalp; the elf occiput sits +1.67 FORWARD of base). **A races.tri on the hair HDPT (NAM0=0, the beard mechanism) was shipped and the ENGINE DOES NOT APPLY IT to type-3 (Hair) parts** — in game the hair rendered unmorphed, floating 2.2+ units behind High Elf occiputs while nearly right on Imperials. Vanilla only puts races tris on heads (type 1) and beards (type 4); vanilla hair is per-race-group MESHES gated by RNAM lists, and the conversion now does the same: generic hair bakes THREE meshes — base scalp (bare stem), elves (`__ev`, fitted to base+HighElfRace; HighElf==DarkElf exactly, WoodElf within 1.4 — vanilla shares one hair set across all three too), orc (`__or`) — with FOUR HDPTs per variant (the humans+vampires and Dremora lists share the base mesh; see `HDPT_GROUPS`); race-NAMED hair bakes only its own group under its bare stem. `npc_face_mapper` routes each NPC to its race group's variant; group FormIDs extend the variant key with 'D'/'E'/'O' (existing human ids unchanged — no drift). Gate: `test_generic_hair_is_baked_per_race_group`.
  - **The fit surfaces are NECK-EXTENDED** (round 5): the OB head mesh ends at local z -3.5 on the back of the neck, so hair below it had nothing to conform to and kept the occiput's backward delta all the way down — a visible gap off the nape/neck. `_neck_surfaces` appends the body meshes' neck columns (OB body T-pose + SK malebody/femalebody _0, z>103, |x|<7) to BOTH fit surfaces, so the field, refinement and ear-cover floor all see real skin there. Side effect: helmet widening dropped (iron helm x +2.26 -> +0.77) because lower helmet verts now correspond to the neck instead of the jaw.
  - **Round-4 fit refinements (2026-08-24):** the ear cap projects SK ear verts onto the SK's OWN surrounding skull (an OB-socket cap recessed the region: short hair sat 0.4-0.8 under the skin around the ears); an exact-clearance refinement (capped ±0.5, graph-smoothed) removes the sampler's residual bias at the front hairline/nape (signed bias now −0.01); hair (not helmets) gets an EAR-COVER floor — near-skin verts under the REAL eared skin push out to +0.15 (cap 1.3), so short styles drape over the ear like vanilla (style07 below-skin verts 32→4). Hair specular: converted normal-map alpha masks average 94 vs vanilla ~17, so `specular_strength` is scaled per texture (`_spec_strength_for_normal`) — the flat 0.9 read as plastic shine. `HAIR_ALPHA_THRESHOLD` = 16 (35 still cut visible texels of the blindfold band).
  - 🛑 **Never look converted geometry up in `data.blocks`** — it is STALE after the strips→shape conversion replaces block objects. `_fit_prn_head_blocks` did, matched nothing silently, and every helmet fell back to the legacy `ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS_PRN` scale table (sy 1.165 — the in-game "extremely oversized, stretched wide" helmets). Walk `root.tree()` like `apply_armor_offset` does. Guarded by `test_converted_helmet_is_fitted_not_scaled`.
  - 🛑 **BEAST RACES GET THEIR OWN HEAD-GEAR MESH (2026-08-27).** Hair carries its race in the EditorID (`head_fit.fit_race_for_hair`), but a HOOD or HELMET is ONE Oblivion record worn by every race -- there is nothing on the record to route on, so every converted hood/helmet was fitted to the SHARED HUMAN skull and then sat inside a khajiit or argonian head. **Measured head-local:** the khajiit SK head reaches z 14.85 / |x| 8.47 against the human head's 11.51 / 6.85, and over the scalp region beast verts stand mean 1.91 (khajiit) / 1.40 (argonian) proud of the human surface (max 6.87 / 4.29). Signed penetration into the real beast skull, scalp region, blades/m/helmet: **khajiit 342.9 -> 43.0, argonian 466.1 -> 16.4** against a human-on-human baseline of 43.7; robemagearch/hood (skinned): **khajiit 37.1 -> 16.6, argonian 27.2 -> 7.2** against a baseline of 20.6.
    - **The fix mirrors vanilla exactly: a MESH PER RACE FAMILY named by a PER-RACE ARMA.** ARMA has no alternate-model slot -- race targeting is `RNAM` + the `MODL[]` additional races -- so a per-race mesh *requires* a per-race ARMA. Vanilla `ArmorIronHelmet` lists three armatures: `IronHelmetAA` (RNAM=DefaultRace, `Helmet.nif`), `IronHelmetKhajiitAA` (RNAM=KhajiitRace, `HelmetKhajiit.nif`), `IronHelmetArgonianAA` (RNAM=ArgonianRace, `HelmetArgonian.nif`); the same split runs through BoneCrown, Blades, Orcish, Dragonscale, Draugr, Dragonplate, Falmer, ThalmorHood and every Circlet. We write `<name>_khajiit.nif` / `<name>_argonian.nif` (`nif_converter._write_beast_head_variants`) and emit the matching ARMAs (`equipment._build_arma(beast_race=...)`, races in `skyrim_overrides.ARMA_BEAST_RACES`).
    - **The default ARMA must DROP the beast races** (`ARMA_ADDITIONAL_RACES_NONBEAST`) or the engine satisfies a khajiit with the human-fitted armature and never reaches the beast one. Each beast ARMA lists that race's VAMPIRE variant as its additional race (KhajiitRaceVampire 0x88845 / ArgonianRaceVampire 0x8883A), exactly as vanilla does.
    - **Khajiit and Argonian stay SEPARATE, never one shared "beast" mesh** -- the two skulls differ from each other as much as either differs from the human one (khajiit ears sit on TOP of the crown, argonian snout runs to y 15.39 vs khajiit's 13.63).
    - **A beast variant is a full RE-CONVERSION, not a re-fit of the finished mesh.** A hood is multi-bone SKINNED geometry (Bip01 Head + Neck + Clavicles), so its head fit happens inside the retarget wrap (`deform_geoms_wrap`), not in the rigid Prn pass -- there is no later point at which the head verts can be displaced again without redoing the skin solve. `race` therefore threads `convert_nif` -> `_convert_nif` -> `retarget_skin_to_skyrim` -> `deform_geoms_wrap` -> `field_deltas`, AND into `_fit_prn_head_blocks` for the rigid case. Re-reading also keeps each variant a FIRST fit through its race's field rather than a second displacement stacked on the human result.
    - **The gate is the AUTHORED BMDT flags, never the filename**, and the record must claim ONLY head slots (bits 0/1) and NO body slots (bits 2-5). A multi-slot suit (Knight of Order, flags 0x3D) is fitted by where its vertex MASS sits -- the body -- so asset_convert writes no per-race mesh for it; emitting a beast ARMA anyway pointed at a missing file (measured: 14 of 484 beast ARMAs before the gate, all that suit) and a missing mesh renders INVISIBLE, which is worse than a slightly-wrong fit.
    - **No FormID drift**: beast ARMAs are keyed `derive_formid('ARMA', (source_fid, race))` while the human one keeps the bare `source_fid`, so no existing id moves. Measured over Oblivion.esm: 0 main records moved, 0 companions lost, 470 gained across 235 head-gear records. Guarded by `tests/test_beast_head_gear.py`.
  - **Skinned head gear (guard helmets, cloth hoods) takes the SAME field, blended by head weight.** The wrap's correction field is graph-smoothed (DELTA_SMOOTH_PASSES), which smeared the real jaw widening across the whole head: the townguardcho skinned helmet shipped +2.5 units of head-band width and a +31% nose guard ("comically large" in game) even after the wrap's head dst rows were replaced with the exact field. `deform_geoms_wrap` now maps head-weighted verts directly through `head_fit.field_deltas` on their PRE-FK authored positions (per-vertex head-weight-fraction blend; measured after: ear-band +0.07, nose guard +0.02) while clavicle/spine-weighted drape keeps the wrap; field-fitted verts skip the clearance push. The wrap npz's head dst rows are ALSO the field mapping (build_field replaces the ICP head fit), so enforcement measures against the true SK skin. `ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS['helmet']` constants apply only when no field with a head exists.
- **`malehead.nif`/`femalehead.nif` are `BSDynamicTriShape`: verts inline, UVs+normals+tangents in the SKIN PARTITION (2026-08-23)**. `sse_nif._geometry_arrays` returned early on `sse_verts is not None` and handed back the inline buffer's `None` for every other attribute, so both heads read with **zero UVs and zero normals** — silently, since nothing checked. It now falls back **per attribute**, not just for triangles (length-checked against the vertex count). Body/hands/feet targets are unaffected (verified: all 7 wrap targets report uvs == verts).
- **When the field exists, `ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS` are SKIPPED** (nif_converter checks `body_wrap.wrap_available`) -- the field's far-range constant extrapolation replaces that hand-tuned drift table. PRN offsets (`ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS_PRN`) still apply to NON-head Prn pieces (shields); head-attached Prn pieces take the head fit instead (see above), and both constant tables survive only as the fallback when the fit/field data is unavailable.
- **Approaches that FAILED before landing here**: (1) pure surface-relative wrap (offset from body surface, rigid transport through triangle frames) -- preserves clearance perfectly but imprints the fitted map's tangential bunching onto every body-hugging vertex (gauntlets 31% edge failures vs FK's 2%); (2) tangential isometry relaxation of the fitted body -- the scale field is a fixed point of the current state (no-op) and heavy diffusion made fingers hop between surfaces; (3) restoring the normal component after correction-field smoothing -- the normal component of the noise IS the noise (gauntlets 24%). Correction-field smoothing (12 Jacobi passes at load, `DELTA_SMOOTH_PASSES`) is the tuned tradeoff: fewer passes = crisper fit, more = smoother mesh but clipping slowly returns past ~16.
- **Clearance enforcement** (`CLEAR_MARGIN=1.0`, 2 iterations): authored clearance (T-pose vert vs OB body) + outward margin is enforced against the fitted surface. The deficit is DIFFUSED over the (global) armor mesh graph before pushing (raw per-vertex pushes crumple meshes: gauntlets went to 62%), but `PUSH_RAW_KEEP=0.6` of the raw deficit survives as a floor — diffusion alone diluted genuine isolated deficits (shirt-collar rings 0.9-1.9 deep) into surrounding slack. Gates: authored proximity (`CLEAR_PROX=4.0`; 2.5 faded enforcement exactly where collars authored 2-3 off the neck clipped), fit-reliability (local stretch, floored at `REL_FLOOR=0.4` on body triangles — otherwise enforcement dies at wrist/neck seam rings), and **body-part-only** (`part` array; hand/foot fits are noisy at fingers, and gauntlets/boots replace body hands/feet in Skyrim — EXCEPT the wrist/ankle seam region: hand/foot verts within 3 units of the body surface count as body, which is where clothing shoe tops and shirt cuffs clip). In the reliability blend, zero-rel hand/foot triangles ABSTAIN (weighted mean over voters within d_best+2) instead of vetoing — a cuff half-surrounded by hand triangles keeps the forearm's reliability, but boot-shaft verts must not inherit reliability from calf triangles 8+ units away. Verts authored INSIDE the OB body (collar necklines, c0 ~ -0.6..-1.5) get depth-preservation (target = c0, no margin — `CLEAR_INNER_FADE`); excluding them entirely let the field drag collars 2+ units deeper.
- **Metrics tool**: `python -m tools.nif.armor_fit_metrics <src.nif> <converted.nif> [--weight 0|1]` -- edge-failure %, high-frequency distortion (per-tri stretch spread = crumple signal vs smooth reshaping), clearance preservation vs the wrap surfaces, penetration. Distortion is deliberately traded for anti-clipping (user: clipping is visible, distortion is not): iron cuirass ~25% edges>15%, boots ~19%, gauntlets ~7.6%, but flagged penetrating verts are near zero everywhere visible (male shirt collar 73→5, female shirt collar 67→2, gauntlets/boots vs their replaced body parts don't count). Known remaining warts: crotch-cavity hems (cuirass front fauld, robe center panel) where signed distance itself is ill-defined -- hidden in game.

## NIF weapon Prn (attach node) contract
<a id="nif-weapon-prn-contract"></a>
- The draw animation looks for the weapon at the skeleton node matching its WEAP AnimationType; the mesh's `Prn` decides where the engine actually parents it. A mismatch = weapon stays sheathed / hands look empty when drawn (seen THREE times: axes with Prn=WeaponAxe but WEAP type Mace; bows with Prn=WeaponBack; shortswords with Prn=WeaponDagger but WEAP type Sword → "invisible while held", fixed 2026-07-15).
- **Shortswords stay on WeaponSword** (they're Sword-type records); **daggers get Prn=WeaponDagger AND the WEAP record refined to AnimationType Dagger (2)** — the filename-keyword refinement runs on BOTH sides (`_remap_prn` in nif_converter.py and `convert_WEAP` in tes5_import/record_types/equipment.py) keyed on the model basename so they can never diverge.
- **Bows must get Prn='WeaponBow'** (vanilla ironbow.nif), NOT 'WeaponBack' — Oblivion uses 'BackWeapon' for both 2H weapons and bows, so `_remap_prn` refines by filename ('bow' in basename).
- **Bows are exempt from the blanket weapon 180° Y-flip** (the war-axe orientation fix applied to every `_WEAPON_PRN_VALUES` mesh): Oblivion bows already match the Skyrim WeaponBow frame — string plane at x≈-15.7 vs vanilla string bones at x≈-13.7, limbs along ±Y. The flip held them backwards (curve toward the archer).
- **Bow bend rig (`asset_convert/character/bow_rig.py`)**: converted bows get the exact vanilla 7-bone chain (Bow_MidBone → Lo/Up chains → StringBones; locals lifted from vanilla steelbow.nif — the rig is the animation contract, BowProject.hkx clips store absolute local bone transforms) + BGED `Weapons\Bow\BowProject.hkx` + BSXFlags Animated bit (0x08). Geometry is skinned with plain NiSkinInstance (vanilla bows never use BSDismember) using the measured vanilla weight profile (Mid→B1 crossfade |y| 4-16, B1→B2 20-36, tips ~58/42 B2/StringBone; string = SB1↔SB2 lerp). String verts are identified from the Oblivion NiGeomMorpherController draw morph (string moves ~28 units vs limb ~7-10; capture BEFORE controllers are stripped) — verified on all 8 vanilla Oblivion bows.
- **SLSF1_Skinned (shader_flags_1 bit 0x02) is mandatory on the bow shape's BSLightingShaderProperty** — without it the renderer never applies bone deforms: the bow renders frozen in bind pose while the graph animates the bones (string never draws, limbs never bend). Shader conversion runs before the rig exists, so `add_bow_rig` sets the flag itself after skinning (vanilla steelbow SF1=0x82400383 has it set).

## NIF torch Prn — Skyrim carries the torch on the SHIELD node (SOLVED 2026-08-01)
<a id="nif-torch-prn-skyrim-carries"></a>
- Oblivion `Prn='Torch'` → **`'SHIELD'`**, not `'NPC L MagicNode [LMag]'`.
- Skyrim holds the torch in the off-hand: vanilla `meshes\weapons\torch\torch.nif`
  ships `Prn='SHIELD'` (and lives under `weapons\`, not `lights\`). The static
  sconce torches under `clutter\common\` carry **no Prn at all** — they are
  placed world objects, so they are not evidence for the carried case.
- `NPC L MagicNode [LMag]` is the spell-**cast** node; its axes point outward
  from the open palm, so a torch parented there renders rotated ~90° with the
  flame sticking out to the left. Weapons were unaffected because they route
  through the `Weapon*` nodes, which is why this looked torch-specific.
- **Sharing the SHIELD node does NOT make it a shield.** The `remapped ==
  'SHIELD'` branch must be split on the ORIGINAL `prn_val`: a torch takes
  **no shield attach transform**. That transform exists only because Oblivion
  straps a shield to `Bip01 L ForearmTwist` while Skyrim glues the root to the
  SHIELD bone at the grip — a torch is authored at the grip in both games, so
  remapping frames throws it ~65° off with a -20.5 forearm-strap offset. This
  was the second, separate cause of "torch orientation completely wrong": the
  Prn was right, the geometry transform was not.
- Vanilla `torch.nif` is identity rotation, zero translation, geometry at
  identity; flame at +Y (`TorchFire` y≈28.96), matching the converted
  `FlameNode1` y=27 / `AttachLight` y=35.
- Torch **does** still need its own BSInvMarker: `SHIELD` is in
  `_EQUIPPED_PRN_VALUES`, so the per-mesh inventory pass skips it and it would
  otherwise ship none. Vanilla values rot (4712, 0, 0) **zoom 0.82** (shield is
  the same rotation but zoom 1.0) → `TORCH_INV_MARKER_*` in `skyrim_overrides.py`.
- Verified against `references/Skyrim Meshes` — **not** the SSE BSAs, which are
  off-limits (see CLAUDE.md); `asset_convert/sources/skyrim_assets.py` is for the
  runtime pipeline only, never for "what does vanilla do here?" debugging.

## NIF shield conversion
<a id="nif-shield-conversion"></a>
- Shields use BSFadeNode root + Prn='SHIELD' (same as weapons, NOT NiNode like worn armor)
- **Orientation fix**: Oblivion shields are modeled with thin (face-normal) axis along Y. Skyrim's SHIELD bone expects it along Z. A +90° rotation around X is applied to the BSFadeNode root. Root rotation baking wraps this in an inner NiNode.
- **BSInvMarker**: Shields need BSInvMarker for inventory display: rot=(4712,0,0), zoom=1.0 (from vanilla ironshield.nif). Without BSInvMarker, shield is invisible in inventory. Shields keep this constant — they are exempt from the per-mesh inventory-orientation pass (see BSInvMarker section below).
- Oblivion Prn values for shields: 'Shield' or 'Bip01 L ForearmTwist' → remapped to 'SHIELD'
- Oblivion shield geometry names: 'Shield:0', 'Shield:2' (single geometry block, no skin)

## NIF armor ground model (_gnd) conversion
<a id="nif-armor-ground-model-conversion"></a>
- Armor/clothing _gnd files need **BSInvMarker** for inventory display. Without it, items are invisible in the inventory 3D viewer.
- BSInvMarker is added during NiNode→BSFadeNode conversion when `_is_gnd and _in_armor_dir` (constant rot=(1570,0,0) as an initial value), then **recomputed per-mesh by the inventory-orientation finalize pass** (see below).
- BSXFlags: vanilla gnd files use 194 (0xC2); our converted use 130 (0x82). Both load fine.
- **Ground-model detection must match the bare `gnd` suffix, NOT `_gnd` (fixed 2026-07-28, `_is_ground_model`)**: Bethesda's convention is `<item>_gnd.nif`, but assets that came through a Morrowind→Oblivion conversion lost the separator. Morroblivion rewrites `_` as `u`, so the same files arrive as `<item>ugnd.nif` (`cumurobeucommonu02ugnd.nif`, cf. `TXUCUclothwrap01`); others drop the separator after a body-part word (`...shoegnd`, `...shirtgnd`, `...pgnd`, `amuletcommon1gnd`). Census of `export/`: **1,120 files use `_gnd`, 195 do not** — every one of the 195 was misread as *worn armor*. Three failures follow from that single flag, and they are exactly the reported symptoms:
  1. `_is_worn_armor` becomes true → root stays **NiNode** instead of BSFadeNode, so the item **has no collision and floats where it was dropped / can't be picked up**;
  2. the `_is_gnd and _in_armor_dir` guard skips **BSInvMarker** → invisible/unoriented in the inventory viewer;
  3. worst, the `not _is_gnd ... and has_skin` guard lets a *static* ground model be **FK-retargeted onto the Skyrim biped** — this **mangles the mesh**. 48 of the 195 are skinned and were being deformed this way.
  The mangling looks like a mesh-orientation bug (the robe's source bbox is X ±47, Z −86→32, i.e. apparently "on its side") but the source geometry and its bind data are correct and upright — the wide/negative extents are just sleeves and the down-the-bone bind offsets. Nothing needs to be "stood up" first; the mesh only had to skip the retarget. Worn variants of the same items (`cumupantsugucommon010.nif`) always looked fine because they take the worn path legitimately.
  Matching bare `gnd.nif` covers all three spellings. A worn mesh would have to genuinely end in the letters "gnd" to false-positive, which no body slot or equipment word does (verified: the char preceding `gnd.nif` across all assets is only `_`, `u`, or a body-part/index character, plus files named exactly `gnd.nif`).

## BSInvMarker inventory orientation (learned 2026-07-18)
<a id="bsinvmarker-inventory-orientation"></a>
- **Engine convention** (derived empirically with `tools/inv_marker_survey.py` (removed 2026-08-25) across ~500 vanilla meshes, mean alignment 0.97+): stored ushort angles are milliradians; the inventory view rotates the model by `M = Rx(-rx/1000) @ Ry(-ry/1000) @ Rz(-rz/1000)` (column-vector, XYZ order, negated angles) and the camera looks along **+Y** with **+Z as screen-up** (screen-right = X). Reproduces vanilla exactly: ironshield (4712,0,0) = −Z face toward camera; cuirassgnd (1570,0,0) = +Z face toward camera with model −Y at screen-up; iron weapons (4712,6283,0) ≈ pure Rx.
- **Per-mesh computation** (`asset_convert/nif/inv_marker.py`): the finalize pass at the end of `_convert_nif` orients each mesh so the side with the greatest front-facing projected area (of the six area-weighted PCA axis directions of the triangle soup) faces the camera. Screen roll keeps model +Z at screen-up (upright items stay upright); when the view normal is ±Z (items modeled lying flat: books, pelts, plates, gnd armor) it follows the vanilla cuirassgnd rule (−Y up for face-up items, +Y for face-down). Hidden geometry (flags & 1), `Blood*` decal shapes and EditorMarkers are excluded from the analysis.
- **Scope**: applied to every non-creature, non-skinned BSFadeNode root — a marker is inert on meshes never shown in inventory, and clutter/books/ingredients/keys/soul gems have no reliable path signature. Existing markers (gnd) are recomputed; missing ones are added (zoom 1.0).
- **Weapons/shields/quivers are exempt** (`_EQUIPPED_PRN_VALUES`, matched on the post-remap Prn): conversion normalizes them into vanilla attachment frames (Prn node convention / SHIELD attach transform), so the vanilla-derived constants are already exact. The computed value would also flip shields: a shield's concave strap side genuinely has more visible area than its display face.
- Geometry math uses PyFFI's row-vector transform convention throughout — the survey validated stored-marker ↔ pyffi-space relationships end-to-end, so the generator must use the same gather code (`gather_area_normals`).

## NIF skin retargeting (Oblivion → Skyrim skeleton)
<a id="nif-skin-retargeting"></a>
- **Critical**: Oblivion skeleton uses X-up coordinates (spine along X axis). Skyrim uses Z-up (spine along Z)
- **Current approach: Corpus search + L-BFGS-B continuous optimization**:
  1. `tools/generators/kf_animation_explorer.py --build-cache` searches 453 .kf animation files with parallel parsing (ThreadPoolExecutor, 31 workers, ~36s)
  2. Per-bone transform library: 65 bones, 336K candidates from entire animation corpus
  3. Chain-level softmax blend (T=1.0, effectively argmin) over ~25K coherent frames per chain (left/right arm, left/right leg — body chain excluded)
  4. **Multi-start L-BFGS-B refinement**: 50 starting frames per chain, axis-angle rotation perturbation bounded to ±0.35 rad (~20°), parallelized with ThreadPoolExecutor. Discovers poses NOT in the .kf corpus.
  5. L/R mirroring for symmetry
  6. Pre-computes delta matrices `inv(rest_world) @ anim_world` per bone, saved to `asset_convert/generated/best_animation_pose.json`
  7. `skin_retarget.py` Phase B.1: loads pre-computed deltas, applies standard LBS using OB skin weights: `v' = Σ w_i * (v @ delta_i)`
  8. Phase A: repositions bones to Skyrim skeleton positions
  9. Phase C+D: recomputes bind matrices (`manual_update_bind_position`) and skin partitions
  10. **FK+Gaussian double-deformation MUST be avoided** — Gaussian spatial blend only runs when FK was NOT applied.
- **FK results**: Post-mirror RMSD 9.64 (was 9.73 corpus-only). Legs: 2.8/1.8→1.08/1.08 (62% improvement). Arms: 4.4→4.0 (10%). 37/37 tests pass, 396 armor NIFs 0 errors.
  - **`_mat3_to_quat` NIF convention**: This function expects a column-vector convention matrix. PyFFI Matrix33 / NIF matrices use row-vector convention so `_mat3_to_quat(NIF_Matrix)` returns the CONJUGATE. In `skin_retarget.py` the delta matrices are numpy column-convention, so pass `_mat3_to_quat(delta[:3,:3].T)` (transpose, no sign flip). For collision baking this is moot — **do not apply _mat3_to_quat to bhkRigidBodyT at all**.
- **Spatial blend residual was wrong direction**: `v_spatial` (spatial blend from OB rest ≈ 50% to SK) minus `v_fk` (FK ≈ 90% to SK) = vector pointing BACKWARD toward the LESS-transformed position. DQS inherently handles joint boundaries — no separate residual needed.
- **ProcessPoolExecutor causes issues on Windows**: Exit code 1 + slightly worse results. Reverted to sequential `for` loop for L-BFGS-B multi-start. Module-level `_lbfgsb_trial_worker` kept (clean, no harm). ThreadPoolExecutor for first kf-parsing step is fine (I/O-bound).
- **Geometric limit**: Arm RMSD ~4.0 is the minimum achievable with rotation-only optimization. UpperArmTwist (err=13.4) and ForearmTwist (err=9.4) contribute 56% of arm cost from bone LENGTH differences between OB/SK skeletons. Excluding twist bones from cost made mesh quality WORSE (larger main-bone rotations).
- **Body chain**: Including spine in optimization gives spine RMSD 5.59 but BREAKS cuirass edges (18.8% fail) — spine deltas distort LBS. Spine gets identity delta; Phase A handles repositioning.
- **Gaussian spatial blend (fallback)**: Only runs when best_animation_pose.json is absent. Uses distance-based Gaussian-weighted bone blending with σ=20.
- Vertices in OB armor NIFs are in standard world-space coordinates (Z-up), NOT in the OB convention-rotated space.
- NiSkinData B_bone = inv(W_sk_bone) when M_mesh = identity (standard for skinned armor)
- Skeleton data: `asset_convert/generated/skeleton_bones_skyrim_{male,female}.json` and `skeleton_bones_oblivion.json`
- Female armor detected via `/f/` in path → uses female skeleton data
- PRN meshes (single bone, identity B) are NOT reposed — they're rigidly attached to one bone
- **Critical**: ALWAYS use `manual_update_bind_position()` instead of PyFFI's `update_bind_position()`. PyFFI's version computes wrong B values when geometry has a non-identity local transform. The manual numpy version handles this correctly.
- **Test suite**: `tests/test_skin_retarget.py` — 37 tests covering skeleton loading, bone mapping, MBW=I, vertex deformation, bone position accuracy, edge length preservation (<10% failure for cuirass, <5% for boots), full converter integration, skin partitions, PRN handling, BSDismemberSkin. All 37 pass.
- **Previous approaches that FAILED** (16+ attempts):
  - v2 bind-matrix-only (no vertex deformation): Arms stuck in A-pose at rest.
  - Skin-weight-based DQS/LBS: Sharp weight boundaries → 24-82% edge failure
  - Gaussian spatial blend alone: 40-50% displacement dilution on arms (normalized weight averaging)
  - FK LBS + Gaussian together: Double deformation → 13.9% edge failure
  - Laplacian-smoothed mesh weights: Created discontinuities. REVERTED.
  - Global/per-mesh inverse filter, RBF interpolation, 2x global overshoot: All failed (see repo memory for full list)

## Distorted worn clothing — nested bones placed with the wrong operand order (SOLVED 2026-08-25)
<a id="distorted-worn-clothing-nested-bones"></a>

- **Symptom**: worn shirts and armour render with long tapering spikes shooting
  out of the body, while torso and trousers sit correctly. Reported in game on
  Nehrim's `LowerShirt10` ("Flickweste", `Clothes\LowerClass\10\M\shirt.NIF`).
- **Cause**: Phase A of `retarget_skin_to_skyrim` computed a nested bone's local
  transform as `inv(parent_W) @ W_sk` — the COLUMN-vector form. This module is
  row-vector throughout (`m44_to_np` puts translation in row 3, and
  `get_transform` composes `world = local @ parent`), so the correct expression
  is `W_sk @ inv(parent_W)`. Now `skin_retarget.local_for_world`, guarded by
  `tests/test_skin_retarget.py::TestLocalForWorld`.
- 🔴 **Why it hid for months although the line never changed.** `git log -L`
  shows it untouched since the initial commit. Bones parented DIRECTLY to the
  skeleton root take the `parent is skel_root` shortcut and never multiply at
  all — and the output's bone tree used to be **flat**, every bone a direct
  child of the root. `7c6e3df` ("bake geometry to skeleton space before
  retargeting", 2026-07-28) made the tree **nested**, and from then on every
  bone below the first level ran through the faulty line. Verified by building
  the same mesh in a throwaway worktree at `f43ec32`, the commit before: 0
  misplaced bones there, 14 of 22 one commit later.
- **The signature to recognise it by**: clavicle, pelvis and neck are EXACTLY
  right (depth 1) while everything below them is displaced, and the error
  compounds down each chain. Measured on the shirt: UpperArm 85.87, Forearm
  162.78, Hand 275.97, Spine2 20.76 units — and the wrong operand order
  reproduces those four numbers to four decimals.
- 🔴 **Why no structural check could see it, and what to check instead.**
  `manual_update_bind_position` derives the bind matrices FROM these node
  positions, so the file stays internally consistent: weight pairs (587/587),
  `_0`/`_1` rig equality, skin partitions, dismember slots, bone names, no
  missing bones, and `S @ B_i @ W_i = I` all pass. The game animates the
  ACTOR's skeleton instead, which is where the disagreement lives. The only
  check that sees it compares bone node positions against the skeleton —
  `tools/skin_skeleton_check.py`. This is the concrete case behind CLAUDE.md's
  "a CLEAN audit is not an alibi".
- **After the fix** (full `--meshes-only` rebuild, spot-checked in game by the
  user 2026-08-26): clothes and armour female 100% correct nodes, armour male
  99.1%, clothes male 94.1%; the reported shirt 14/22 → 0. `weight_pair_check`
  unchanged at 587/587, so nothing that worked before regressed.
- **Not yet diagnosed**: about a dozen male meshes keep 1–2 misplaced nodes
  each (`upperclass\01|03|05\m\shirt`, `middleclass\02\m\pants`,
  `middleclass\mcshirtsneaky\m\shirt`, `nehrimsoldier\m\cuirass03`), offsets
  6.7–67.4 units. Smaller, and mechanically different from the Phase A fault.


## Creature skin render crash — >80 skin bones per shape (SOLVED 2026-07-10)
<a id="creature-skin-render-crash-80"></a>
- Symptom: render-thread `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` in a VCRUNTIME140 memcpy
  (`vmovdqa [rcx+…]`) inside BSBatchRenderer pass setup (BSUtilityShader =
  shadow-depth pass); crash objects show NiSkinInstance/NiSkinPartition +
  BSTriShape named `"(<armo fid>)[0]/(<arma fid>) [50%]"`. FormIDs resolve
  (via `tools/esm/tes5_esm_reader.py <esm> --formid <fid>`) to the generated
  creature skin ARMO/ARMA.
- **Root cause (proven by crash-log registers)**: SSE memcpys one 3x4 matrix
  (48 B) per NiSkinInstance bone into a fixed **80-matrix (3840 B) buffer**.
  Imp = 85 bones → copy size RBP=4080=85×48, fault at dest offset 3840=80×48,
  R8=464 remaining. Per-partition bone counts are irrelevant; the per-shape
  TOTAL is the limit. Vanilla max: dragon, 77. The crash needs the shadow
  path, so >80-bone actors can *appear* fine where no shadow-casting light
  hits them (mehrunesdagon/spiderdaedra initially seemed unaffected).
- **Fix (in-game verified)**: `skin_retarget.merge_oversized_skin_bones()` —
  merge the lowest-total-weight LEAF bones into their parents until ≤78
  (SSE_MAX_SKIN_BONES; vanilla max is 77 and splitting at exactly 80 froze the
  game, so stay clearly under). Bind pose is exact (B·W=I at rest); only tip
  articulation (fingertips/ear tips/eyebrows) is lost. Weights renormalized;
  partitions regenerated afterwards.
- **Where it runs matters**: called from `merge_creature_body()` AFTER rig
  grafting — Oblivion body-part NIFs store their skin bones FLAT (no
  parent/child links), so leaf detection only works on the merged rig. The
  hierarchy lookup is BY NAME (bone pointers aren't tree members at part
  stage). Affected creatures: imp 85→78, spiderdaedra 88→78, mehrunesdagon
  98→78; all other 151 merged bodies were already ≤80.
- **Shape-SPLITTING does NOT work** (tested in-game: game froze) — don't
  split skinned shapes to duck the cap; merge bones instead.
- Diagnostics: `tools/nif/skin_partition_dump.py <nif>` (per-shape/partition
  bone/vert/tri counts, flags >80-bone shapes + index-range problems).

## PRN-attached rigid pieces take no FK compensation
<a id="prn-rigid-piece-offsets"></a>

PRN-attached rigid pieces (no real skin in the Oblivion NIF; rigid-skinned
to the Skyrim bone by nif_converter._add_prn_skin).  Their verts are
authored in an upright bone-pivot frame and land EXACTLY in the Skyrim bone
frame after retarget, so the FK-deformation compensation offsets in
ARMOR_PIECE_OFFSETS (e.g. helmet dz=+7, tuned on genuinely skinned helms
like TownguardCho) must NOT be applied — they pushed rigid helms on top of
the head.  The only correction needed is the anatomical difference between
the heads in their respective head-pivot frames, measured from
OB headhuman.nif vs SK malehead.nif (see docs/commentary/asset_convert_nif.md):
  skull top   OB +13.6  SK +11.5  -> dz = -2.1
  Y span      OB [-3.75, +11.31]  SK [-5.97, +11.58] -> the SK skull


## Closing the last ~10% cuirass-edge gap — 17 ideas, 11 measured failures
<a id="cuirass-edge-gap-ideas"></a>

Moved out of `skin_retarget.py`, where it was 260 lines of comment above the
first statement. Baseline at the time: **cuirass 10.80%, gauntlets 2.43%,
boots 0.45%** edge failure (thresholds 15% / 15% / 10%).

Root cause, measured: 418/418 UpperBody failures are Clavicle-adjacent
(238 Clavicle-Clavicle + 104 Clavicle-UpperArmTwist + 76
UpperArmTwist-UpperArmTwist). Adjacent vertices carry different bone-weight
ratios, so DQS gives them slightly different effective rotations and the edge
between them stretches. The residual arm RMSD ~4.0 is a rotation-only floor:
UpperArmTwist (err 13.4) and ForearmTwist (err 9.4) are ~56% of arm cost and
come from bone LENGTH differences, which rotation cannot fix.

**Tried and reverted — do not retry without new evidence:**

| Idea | Approach | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pre-FK per-chain bone-length scaling | reverted |
| 5 | Post-FK per-chain Procrustes/Kabsch snap | reverted |
| 7 | Targeted twist-bone delta propagation | reverted |
| 8 | Factored global+local FK | cuirass 10.80% -> 13.8% |
| 9 | Edge spring relaxation, bone-dominance anchored | 10.80% -> 8.83%, but UV-seam twin vertices tore visible holes; DISABLED |
| 10 | Laplacian deformation, bone-position constrained | all variants reverted; uniform Laplacian unsuitable |
| 11 | Virtual intermediate shoulder-blend bone | 10.80% -> 10.04%, worse than spring |
| 13 | ARAP | cuirass -> 36.21%, boots -> 18.79% |
| 14 | Weight sharpening, gamma sweep 1.5-4.0 | reverted to gamma=1.0 |
| 15 | Cotangent Laplacian correction | cuirass -> 32.5%, catastrophic |
| 16 | Anchor co-rotation prediction (deformation transfer) | 9.05% -> 9.91% |

**Never tried** (predictions only, no measurement): Gaussian pre-warp (2),
thin-plate-spline warp (3), ARAP as originally framed (4), chain-level affine
FK with shear (6), seam-welded spring relaxation (12), anchor-constrained
spring with co-rotation targets (17).

The pattern across 11 failures: any method that lets non-rigid deformation
touch the mesh globally trades a small edge-length win for large distortion
elsewhere. Idea 9 is the only one that ever improved the number, and it
shipped disabled because the artifact it introduced was worse than the metric
it fixed.

## `retarget_skin_to_skyrim` — the four phases, and why the order is fixed
<a id="retarget-phase-order"></a>

`skin_retarget.retarget_skin_to_skyrim` runs four phases in a fixed order.
Each ordering constraint below was paid for by a real defect.

### Phase 0 — bake geometry into skeleton space

Everything downstream (the FK deform, the body wrap, and Phase C's bind-matrix
rewrite) assumes a geometry's stored vertices ALREADY sit in skeleton space.
**That is not part of the skinning contract.** NifSkope renders a skinned mesh
as `bone_world * skin_transform * vertex`, so the authored frame is arbitrary
and it is the bind matrices that stand the mesh up.

Most Oblivion armor happens to be authored with that product ≈ identity, so the
distinction never surfaced — but **81 of 171 Morroblivion clothing meshes** store
geometry in a genuinely different frame.

Phase C (`manual_update_bind_position`) unconditionally rewrites the bind
matrices to `B_i = G @ inv(W_i)`, which FORCES `S @ B_i @ W_i = I`. The
transforms that were standing those meshes upright get destroyed, and the
authored frame cannot be recovered afterwards. So the mesh must be baked into
skeleton space up front — which also makes the raw coordinates mean what every
later stage already assumes they mean.

### Phase B — vertex deformation, BEFORE bone repositioning

The preferred path is the surface-relative wrap: an exact fit onto the Skyrim
body that preserves each vertex's authored clearance from the body surface.
`weight` picks the `_0`/`_1` Skyrim body target for the weight-morph variants.

**The FK animation deform is not dead code superseded by the wrap — it is the
wrap's foundation.** `deform_geoms_wrap` runs `deform_vertices_animation_fk`
internally as its smooth base and only adds the measured correction on top. The
field BUILD itself FK-poses the Oblivion body meshes through this exact path
(with `allow_wrap=False`, so the wrap can never bootstrap from a previous
field), and FK remains the fallback when no wrap field exists for a gender.

### Phase A — move bone NiNodes to Skyrim positions

Bones are processed root-to-leaf (sorted by depth) so a parent's transform is
already set when its children are computed. See `local_for_world` for the
row-vector operand order and why reversing it stayed invisible until the bone
tree became nested.

`manual_update_bind_position` then derives the bind matrices FROM these node
positions, so **a wrong position leaves the file internally consistent** and no
structural check can catch it. In game the engine uses the actor's skeleton
instead, and the vertices shoot off as spikes.

### Phase C+D — recompute skin data, regenerate partitions

A PRN piece hangs off ONE bone: in Oblivion the whole piece is parented to it,
and each shape's node transform positions it within that bone's frame.
