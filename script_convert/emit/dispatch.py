"""Command dispatch: one call node -> Papyrus text.

This is what `_emit_function`'s 76-branch chain became.  The chain answered
three questions in sequence and the answers are now three lookups:

    1. Does a HANDLER claim this name?   -> `commands.REGISTRY`
    2. Does a ROW describe it?           -> `constants.COMMAND_ROWS`
    3. Neither                           -> the generic mapped-call rendering

A handler may decline by returning None (`getfirstref` converts only the actor
walk), and dispatch falls through to the row exactly as if it had not existed.
