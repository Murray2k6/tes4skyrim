"""An overlay is attached to a worldspace only if it puts records THERE.

`create_lod` picks a worldspace's overlays from the master chain: every selected
plugin that depends on the worldspace's owner. That gate answers what a plugin is
ALLOWED to touch, not what it DOES touch, and the two diverge badly. On the
12-plugin selection all 9 of Oblivion.esm's dependents were stacked onto all 18 of
its worldspaces — 162 overlay attachments, each one a full re-parse of the file in
both the object and terrain generators, measured at 114 s of which 4 s was useful.

`touched_worldspace_fids` closes that gap by reporting the worldspaces a plugin
actually has WRLD/CELL/LAND/REFR records under.

The subtle half is what it must NOT do. A raw FormID means nothing across
plugins: the index byte is an offset into each file's OWN master list, so
Morrowind_ob.esm's 02xxxxxx and Tamriel.esp's 02xxxxxx are both "self" and name
completely unrelated records. The two really do collide on 4 CELL FormIDs, and
resolving one plugin's cells against another's table turns that coincidence into
183 phantom overrides — Morrowind interior clutter dragged into Cyrodiil's
distant terrain. Scope is therefore judged per file, from its own records only.
