"""Per-worldspace world-map cloud bank meshes.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Skyrim's world map draws a bank of cloud planes over the terrain.  The mesh is
chosen by a three-step fallback in the engine (SkyrimSE.exe, function at RVA
0x2c7e00):

    1. the PARENT worldspace's cloud model, when WRLD PNAM bit 2
       ("Use Map Data") is set;
    2. this worldspace's own WRLD `MODL` ("Cloud Model" in xEdit's TES5 WRLD
       definition, wbRStruct('Cloud Model', [wbGenericModel]));
    3. neither set (empty string) -> a HARDCODED default.  The tail of that
       function is

           cmp  byte ptr [rax], 0
           jne  <return it>
           lea  rax, [rip + 0x1397ef1]      ; -> 0x14165fd50

       and 0x14165fd50 is the string `Meshes\\Sky\\SkyrimWorldMapCloudBank.nif`.
       That is the ONLY cross-reference to it in the binary.

Oblivion has no world-map cloud layer to convert from, and vanilla Skyrim
authors no MODL either (0 of 35 uncompressed Skyrim.esm WRLDs carry one) -- so
every converted worldspace lands on step 3 and inherits a cloud bank sized for
Skyrim's Tamriel.

The bank is four flat XY sheets, each spanning +/-56902.8 local units at node
scale 8.0, i.e. 910,445 units (222 cells) across.  Against the worldspaces we
actually emit that ranges from roughly right to wildly oversized:

    Skyrim Tamriel      119 x  94 cells   ~1.9x cover   (what Bethesda tuned)
    TES4Tamriel         134 x 129 cells   ~1.7x
    NehrimWorldspace     92 x 101 cells   ~2.2x
    Arktwend             39 x  25 cells   ~5.7x
    ErothinFeste         16 x  26 cells   ~8.5x

so the small worldspaces get a cloud deck many times their landmass and it
reads as a solid overcast sheet rather than scattered banks.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Emit one cloud-bank NIF per worldspace, scaled so the sheet covers that
worldspace's own NAM0/NAM9 rectangle at the same proportion Bethesda's covers
Skyrim's Tamriel, and point the WRLD's MODL at it.

Only the X/Y span is scaled.  The per-child Z offsets (0 / 1000 / 1500 / 12500)
are cloud ALTITUDES -- scaling them with the horizontal span would sink the
deck into the terrain on a small worldspace and launch it out of frame on a
large one.  Scaling is applied to each child node's `scale` (the four sheets
sit at scale 8.0 under a scale-1.0 BSFadeNode root), which leaves vertex data,
shader properties and the alpha-fade controllers untouched.

    half-float packed vertices) while `references/Skyrim Meshes` holds the LE
    NiTriShape form (182,953 bytes).  A patch written against either layout
    silently no-ops on the other, which is exactly what happened to the first
    version of this function.  sse_nif.read_nif normalises both to LE
    NiTriShape, so the edit is done on the graph and written out LE.

    Scale: X and Y are stretched INDEPENDENTLY (see compute_axis_scales), so
    the deck can match a map whose aspect differs from Skyrim's.  A NIF node
    `scale` is a single float and cannot express that, so the stretch is baked
    into the VERTICES and each node's scale is set to 1.0 -- the node scale and
    the vertex scale multiply, so leaving it at the stock 8.0 would apply the
    factor twice.  Only the horizontal axes are touched; vertex Z (the sheet's
    own relief) and the nodes' Z translations (cloud ALTITUDES) are preserved.

    Centre: the sheet nodes' X/Y translations are set to `center`.  Stock is
    (0,0) on all four, and the root above them is an identity-transform
    BSFadeNode at scale 1.0, so a node translation is already in world units --
    no division by the parent scale, and the node's own scale applies to its
    vertices, not to its translation.  Setting rather than adding is safe for
    the same reason the stock values are all zero, and keeps the operation
    idempotent if the mesh is ever regenerated from a previous output.

    Flatten: the stock sheets are not flat.  Each carries billowing Z relief --
    up to 3523 local units (~28,000 world units at scale 8) over the interior,
    with a skirt dropping to -899 at the rim.  That relief is modelled for
    Skyrim's terrain, most visibly the bank piled around High Hrothgar; over a
    converted worldspace it is a mountain of cloud on unrelated flat land.
    `keep` is the fraction retained (0.0 = flat, 1.0 = untouched), applied
    about each shape's MEDIAN z so the sheet settles onto its own base plane
    instead of being dragged to local zero -- the rim skirt is part of the
    silhouette, and collapsing everything to 0 would flare it up into the deck.
