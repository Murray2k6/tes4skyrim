"""Generate _far.nif LOD meshes by decimating full-resolution Skyrim NIFs.

Called from lod_gen.generate_lod() as a pre-pass to ensure all LOD-flagged
objects have a _far.nif before LODGenx64 is invoked.

Algorithm
---------
1. Read the converted Skyrim NIF (v20.2.0.7, BSStream 83).
2. Transform every solid (non-skinned) shape into a common root space and
   concatenate it into ONE vertex/triangle soup, tagging each triangle with
   the shape it came from.
3. Simplify that soup with quadric-error-metric (QEM) half-edge collapses:
   positions are welded for topology, edges are collapsed cheapest-first into
   a surviving original vertex, the moved corner's UV is interpolated onto the
   survivor, boundary edges carry constraint quadrics so open rims shrink last,
   and collapses that would flip a face normal are rejected.
4. Split the surviving triangles back out by material tag and write each group
   into its original shape, so every shape keeps its own texture and shader.
5. Recompute smooth per-vertex normals; recompute tangent/bitangent vectors
   from UV differentials (standard tangent-space method).
6. Strip collision, controllers, skin, vertex colors, and extra data from all
   nodes, and clear the VertexColors shader flag (SF2 bit 0x20).
7. Write to <model_base>_far.nif.

Decimating the whole model as one welded topology is what keeps it watertight.
Shapes used to be decimated INDEPENDENTLY, which left a rim shared by two
shapes as a free boundary to both: each side chose different survivors, the
rims drifted apart, and the gap was the hole.  Welding makes the shared rim one
graph node, so a collapse moves both sides at once.

BSLightingShaderProperty is COPIED from the source (correct flags, no
recreation) — this fixes the missing ZBufferTest flag that caused objects to
not render in-game.

#   - shapes were decimated INDEPENDENTLY, so shared rims drifted apart and

#     `_MIN_SRC_TRIS`/`_MIN_TRIS` deleted small shapes rather than risk them.
#   - collapses kept the ORIGINAL UV, so charts were squeezed into a third of
#     their proper footprint; `_MAX_DEV_FRAC` was clamped to 0.03 to limit the
#     shearing, which stalled reduction at ~40% of source verts against a
#     nominal 8% target.

    # pieces, which grinds each to nothing and takes whole planks with it.

    map straight to the LOD tier, while the decimation rebuilds the geometry

    parallax when CONVERTING a source `_far.nif` fixes only half of it; a tier
