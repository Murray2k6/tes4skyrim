"""Which wearable NIF variants the converted plugin actually references.

A converted wearable can exist on disk in three forms:

    armor/iron/m/cuirass.nif      the plain converted mesh
    armor/iron/m/cuirass_0.nif    weight-0 variant
    armor/iron/m/cuirass_1.nif    weight-1 variant (body-morphed)

but the plugin never references all three for the same mesh, so writing all
three always wastes space:

  * ARMA sets the weight slider ONLY for gear covering body/hands/feet
    (tes5_import.record_types.equipment._build_arma).  With the slider on it
    references <name>_1.nif and the engine derives its partner _0 — the plain
    <name>.nif is dead.  With the slider off it references the plain
    <name>.nif — both _0 and _1 are dead.
  * ARMO's ground (dropped-item) model is the WorldModel when there is one and
    otherwise falls back to the biped path, which keeps the plain <name>.nif
    alive for the ~76 shields and odds and ends that ship no _gnd mesh.

This module derives that same set of decisions straight from the export, so the
converter writes exactly the files the plugin asks for.  The rules here MUST
track equipment.convert_ARMO / _build_arma — if the slider condition or the
ground-model fallback changes there, change it here too.
