"""Voice-type identity for a plugin's own races.

Oblivion names a voice folder after the race's DISPLAY name (the RACE record's
FULL), not its EditorID:

    sound\\voice\\<plugin>\\<FULL lowercased>\\<gender>\\<topic>_<fid>_<n>.mp3

In the English game the two strings are identical, so the distinction never
shows and a table keyed on EditorIDs works by accident.  In a localised plugin
they diverge and everything keyed on the EditorID stops matching the folders on
disk.  Measured on Nehrim.esm:

    RACE EditorID                     FULL (= folder name)
    Alemanne1, Alemanne2, Alemanne1Gabor, ...   Alemanne
    HighElf                                     Hochelf
    DarkElf                                     Eraterna
    Argonian                                    Argonier

Both halves of the voice pipeline resolve identity through this module so they
cannot disagree:

  * the importer creates one VTYP record per (voice key, gender) and points
    EVERY race EditorID sharing that FULL at it, so the seven Alemanne races
    share one voice type;
  * the sound stage maps each source race folder to the same VTYP EditorID, so
    generic per-race lines land in the folder the speaker's VTYP names.

For Oblivion this reproduces the previously hardcoded names exactly — "High
Elf" -> HighElf, "Dark Elf" -> DarkElf, "Golden Saint" -> GoldenSaint — so
every race keeps the voice type it already had.

A race with no FULL is SKIPPED rather than falling back to its EditorID: the
folder on disk is the display name, so a race that has no display name has no
folder, and giving it an identity here would point it at an empty directory.
Oblivion's VampireRace is exactly that case and the fixed table routes it to
Imperial on purpose.
