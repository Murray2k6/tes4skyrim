"""Landscape normal-map specular fix: DXT1 → DXT5 with a dark alpha channel.

Skyrim's landscape shader reads the normal map's ALPHA channel as the
specular mask.  Oblivion's terrain shader never used it, so most Oblivion
landscape normal maps ship as DXT1 (no alpha channel).  DXT1 samples
alpha = 1.0 everywhere, which Skyrim treats as a full-strength specular
mask — the entire terrain turns glossy/shiny.  (Oblivion normal maps that
are already DXT5 carry a real specular mask in alpha and are left alone.)

Fix: re-container each DXT1 landscape ``*_n.dds`` as DXT5 with a constant
dark alpha (32/255 ≈ Oblivion-typical low specular).  DXT1 and DXT5 share
the same 8-byte color block format, so color data is reused verbatim; only
blocks in DXT1's 3-color mode (c0 <= c1, which DXT5 would misdecode as a
4-color block) get their endpoints swapped and indices remapped.  No
recompression loss.
