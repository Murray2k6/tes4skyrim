"""
Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) for converted NIF meshes.

Used by the import pipeline to set accurate OBND values on records instead of
type-based defaults.

This module is the READER half only.  The cache is produced by
`asset_convert.collision.collision_extract.scan_mesh_data`, which computes bounds and
collision from a SINGLE NIF parse — parsing dominates both analyses, so the
bounds scan used to re-read every mesh the collision scan had just read.  See
that function for the details.

    scan_mesh_data(mesh_dir, collision_cache, bounds_cache)  — after mesh
                                                               conversion
    load_mesh_bounds(cache_path)                             — import_main.py

Path keys are normalised: lowercase, forward slashes, relative to the mesh
output directory root.  Example: "tes4/furniture/chairnoble01.nif".

Records store raw TES4 model paths like "Furniture\\ChairNoble01.NIF"; after
_prefix_path() and normalisation these map to the same key.
