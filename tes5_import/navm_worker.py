"""Process-pool worker for parallel PGRD→NAVM navmesh generation.

This is a DELIBERATELY light module.  On Windows the process pool uses `spawn`,
so every worker re-imports the worker's module at start-up.  Importing the full
`import_main` (which pulls in the dialogue/creature/script/asset pipelines) in
each child cost several GB of RSS per process and exhausted RAM, killing workers
with BrokenProcessPool.  Depending only on `pgrd_to_navm` (which itself imports
just text_reader/writer, and loads scipy/shapely lazily) keeps each child small.

FormIDs are pre-assigned in the parent (job['navm_fid']) so no PluginWriter — an
unpicklable, shared-state object — has to cross the process boundary.

The Havok collision cache is a module global in `asset_convert.collision_extract`;
a spawned child does NOT inherit the parent's loaded copy, so each worker loads it
once from disk in the pool initializer.  Without this, every cell would voxelize
an empty world and emit no navmesh at all.

        get_formid() applies (e.g. +1 for Oblivion.esm behind Skyrim.esm).  If

        (PathingCell ParentCELL/ParentWRLD, door REFR links, ONAM base objects)
        keeps master index 0x00 instead of the plugin's real index.  The engine
        then can't resolve the navmesh's parent cell at load and null-derefs in
        Hook_NavMeshLoad.  MUST be set before any get_formid() call.

        navmesh is voxelized from.  Without it every cell has no geometry and
        produces no navmesh at all.
