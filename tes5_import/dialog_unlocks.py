"""AddTopic visibility -> Skyrim unlock-global analysis.

Oblivion's central dialogue-visibility mechanic (see the oblivion-dialog-system
skill): a Type-0/1 topic only appears in the player's topic list once it has
been ADDED — by an INFO's Add-Topics data list (NAME subrecords), an `AddTopic`
result-script command, a quest-stage result script, or automatically when a
spoken line's response text mentions the topic's name (Oblivion highlights and
auto-adds mentioned topic names). Skyrim has no AddTopic, so without a gate
every converted topic shows as soon as its quest runs (e.g. Azzan offering
"Rats" before the contract was ever discussed).

Re-expression in Skyrim terms:
  * one GLOB `TES4Unlock_<topic>` (0.0) per explicitly-AddTopic'd topic;
  * every INFO of a gated topic gets `GetGlobalValue(GLOB) == 1` injected;
  * every REVEAL event sets the global to 1 from a Papyrus fragment:
      - INFO Add-Topics data list / `AddTopic X` in its result script,
      - response text mentioning the gated topic's FULL name (whole word),
      - quest stage result scripts containing `AddTopic X`.
    INFO fragments fire OnEnd — the unlock lands right when the line finishes,
    before the topic menu refreshes, matching Oblivion's timing. Globals
    persist in saves, matching AddTopic's permanent player-knowledge model.

Gating is limited to topics that appear in an explicit Add-Topics data list or
AddTopic command: those are the designer-controlled reveals. Topics only ever
revealed by name-mention stay ungated (visible when conditions pass) — gating
them would risk dead content on any name-match miss. A greeting's explicit
reveal runs through its fragment, preserving that greeting's conditions.
Choice (TCLT) targets
that are explicitly added are gated like any other, with their TCLT-parent
INFOs as additional revealers (choosing the path unlocks and persists, like
Oblivion); choice targets never explicitly added are handled by the branch
level instead (non-top-level = choice-only reachability).

Both the importer (conditions, GLOB records, VMAD property bindings) and the
script pipeline (fragment .psc bodies) consume the same plan; keys are low-24
FormIDs so the plan is identical regardless of the load-order offset.
